Patients/Method: We developed three main types of scotomectomy-plasty: unilateral, bilateral and resection of the inferior pole, utilized in a series of 50 scrotomectomy-plasty in a homogeneous series of 148 hydrocelectomy in 117 patients. Results: 92% of patients treated by scrotomectomy-plasty had a hydrocele at an advanced stage (54% stage III and 38% stage IV). In 24% of preoperative indications for scrotomectomy-plasty we observed during surgery a sufficient retraction of the scrotum to prevent it. Thus, out of 1 17 patients 43% had a scrotomectomy-plasty. We recorded 6 complications, all in hydroceles stages III or IV with scrotomectomy-plasty. Five of these patients had a hematocele or chylocele. Two did not benefit from our compressive dressing. These complications only delayed by a few days the complete cure. In all cases the esthetic result was very satisfactory. Conclusion: The esthetic and functional result of hydrocelectomy is significantly completed through resectionplasty of the scrotum without increasing the postoperative morbidity in the immediate and close follow up.

Progressively applied to the whole Polynesian population since 1974, this very innovative programme had generated the idea of a pos-sible eradication of the parasitosis. Meanwhile at laboratory level important progress in Immunology (mainly the validation of rapid diagnosis tests detecting a specific antigenemia) and later in Molecular Biology (with the main application being the follow-up of the infection status of the vector Aedes polynesiensis) questioned this optimistic concept (one lesson given by the study of Maupiti island, considered as a 0% reference island for a long time). More recently a regional WHO-sponsorized control programme, called PacELF, has for main objective the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in the South Pacific region near 2010.

A statistical model of the extrinsic cycle duration as a function of temperature is described and used to distinguish three patterns of W. bancrofti transmission dynamics: continuous, fluctuating and discontinuous, occurring from north to south geographically among French Polynesian archipelagos. In the northerly Marquesas Islands (8-11 degrees S) filariasis transmission is continuous and very active, facilitated by perennially high temperatures combined with constantly high rates of man-vector contact. In the southerly Australes Islands (21-28 degrees S) filariasis transmission is seasonally discontinuous and, during the cooler months (May-September), the model predicts virtually no transmission because the cycle duration exceeds the life expectancy of the vector. In the Society Islands (16-18 degrees S), between the Marquesas and Australes, transmission is predicted to be intermediate as expected from their latitude, with seasonally fluctuating transmission potential. In the Tuamotu Islands (also geographically intermediate: 14-23 degrees S), with theoretically perennial transmission potential, transmission occurs only intermittently, being limited by other human and environmental factors whereby man-vector contact is confined to seasonal agricultural situations. Generally, among French Polynesian archipelagos where Aedes polynesiensis is the vector, the transmission potential for W. bancrofti and resulting disease manifestations of lymphatic filariasis in humans are correlated with ambient temperature due to the degree of southern latitude.", "Year": "2001", "Authors": "Lardeux, F., Cheffort, J.", "Journal": "Medical and Veterinary Entomology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "15(2)", "Pages": "167-176", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0269-283X.2001.00305.x", "Work_Location": "French Polynesia", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "French Polynesia", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_108 Lardeux and Cheffort 2001 MED VET ENTOMOL Ambient temperature effects on the extrinsic incubation period of Wuchereria bancrofti in Aedes polynesiensis.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "PacELF_108_Lardeux_and_Cheffort_2001_MED_VET_ENTOMOL_Ambient_temperature_effects_on_the_extrinsic_incubation_period_of_Wuchereria_bancrofti_in_Aedes_polynesiensis.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_108_Lardeux_and_Cheffort_2001_MED_VET_ENTOMOL_Ambient_temperature_effects_on_the_extrinsic_incubation_period_of_Wuchereria_bancrofti_in_Aedes_polynesiensis.txt"}, {"ID": "109", "Source Collection": "Fiji", "SiteNum": "522", "HardcopyLocation2020": "", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "786", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Control of the Aedes vectors of the dengue viruses and Wuchereria bancrofti: the French Polynesian experience", "Description": "In most of the 130 islands of French Polynesia, the stenotopic mosquitoes Aedes aegypti (the main local vector for the viruses causing dengue) and Aedes polynesiensis (the main local vector of Wuchereria bancrofti) share many breeding sites in water containers such as discarded cans, coconut shells, buckets and water-storage pots and drums. In addition to selective application of insecticides, non-polluting methods of controlling these mosquitoes have been evaluated during the last decade in two main ecological situations: (1) villages, where Aedes breeding sites are typically peridomestic; and (2) flooded burrows of land crabs, the major source of Ae. polynesiensis throughout the South Pacific region. Large-scale trials of biological control agents, such as mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis and Poecilia reticulata) and copepods (Mesocyclops aspericornis), and of integrated-control strategies have demonstrated the efficacy of certain techniques and control agents against the target Aedes populations in some village situations. Generally, mechanical methods (the use of layers of polystyrene beads against mosquito larvae and pupae, and screening against adult mosquitoes) were more efficient than use of the biological control agents. By integrating several methods of control, mosquito densities (as measured by human-bait collections and larval surveys) were reduced significantly compared with the results of concurrent sampling from untreated villages, and control remained effective for months after the interventions ceased. In land-crab burrows, the first attempts to control Aedes larvae used bacterial agents (Bacillus thuringiensis) and predatory copepods gave disappointing results. Mesocyclops aspericornis could be an effective control agent if the burrows were constantly flooded, but most burrows dry out and refill periodically, so copepod populations do not survive. As it proved difficult to reach all corners of the long sinuous burrows with any control agent, larvicidal (chlorpyrifos-methyl) baits were developed for foraging crabs to carry into their burrows. This novel technique proved to be effective and could become the method of choice for treating crab burrows. Further research is underway to find the optimum (biological or chemical) larvicidal ingredient for the crab bait. Despite the ecological and logistical challenges of controlling the Aedes vectors of the dengue viruses and W. bancrofti in so many scattered islands, the French Polynesian experience indicates that relatively simple methods can be integrated and applied effectively and economically.

This program is progressing well in many countries. However, progress has been slow in some countries, and others have not yet started their mass drug administration (MDA) programs. Acceleration is needed. We studied how increasing MDA frequency from once to twice per year would affect program duration and costs by using computer simulation modeling and cost projections. We used the LYMFASIM simulation model to estimate how many annual or semiannual MDA rounds would be required to eliminate LF for Indian and West African scenarios with varied pre-control endemicity and coverage levels. Results were used to estimate total program costs assuming a target population of 100,000 eligibles, a 3% discount rate, and not counting the costs of donated drugs. A sensitivity analysis was done to investigate the robustness of these results with varied assumptions for key parameters. Model predictions suggested that semiannual MDA will require the same number of MDA rounds to achieve LF elimination as annual MDA in most scenarios. Thus semiannual MDA programs should achieve this goal in half of the time required for annual programs. Due to efficiency gains, total program costs for semiannual MDA programs are projected to be lower than those for annual MDA programs in most scenarios. A sensitivity analysis showed that this conclusion is robust. Semiannual MDA is likely to shorten the time and lower the cost required for LF elimination in countries where it can be implemented. This strategy may improve prospects for global elimination of LF by the target year 2020.", "Year": "2013", "Authors": "Stolk, W.A., ten Bosch, Q.A., de Vlas, S.J., Fischer, P.U., Weil, G.J., Goldman, A.S.", "Journal": "PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "7(1)", "Pages": "e1984", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001984", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Not matched on Scopus (e.g. Worldwide) but confirmed Open", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_314 Stolk et al 2013 PLOS NTDs Modeling the Impact and Costs of Semiannual Mass Drug Administration for Accelerated Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_314_Stolk_et_al_2013_PLOS_NTDs_Modeling_the_Impact_and_Costs_of_Semiannual_Mass_Drug_Administration_for_Accelerated_Elimination_of_Lymphatic_Filariasis.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_314_Stolk_et_al_2013_PLOS_NTDs_Modeling_the_Impact_and_Costs_of_Semiannual_Mass_Drug_Administration_for_Accelerated_Elimination_of_Lymphatic_Filariasis.pdf"}, {"ID": "315", "Source Collection": "Fiji", "SiteNum": "728", "HardcopyLocation2020": "", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "A single dose of doxycycline in combination with diethylcarbamazine for treatment of bancroftian filariasis", "Description": "Standard treatment of lymphatic filariasis with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is associated with systemic adverse reactions, thought to be due to the release of microfilariae material and Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria into the blood.

Presently used antifilarial drugs are able to strongly reduce transmission and will thus ultimately lower the burden of morbidity associated with the infection, however, a chemotherapeutic principle that directly induces a halt or improvement in the progression of the morbidity in already infected individuals would constitute a major lead. In search of such a more-effective drug to complement the existing ones, in an area endemic for bancroftian filariasis in Ghana, 33 microfilaremic and 18 lymphedema patients took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 6-wk regimen of 200 mg/day doxycycline. Four months after doxycycline treatment, all patients received 150-200 lg/kg ivermectin and 400 mg albendazole. Patients were monitored for Wolbachia and microfilaria loads, antigenemia, filarial dance sign (FDS), dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels, and plasma levels of lymphangiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor-C [VEGF-C] and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 [(s)VEGFR-3]). Lymphedema patients were additionally monitored for stage (grade) of lymphedema and the circumferences of affected legs. Wolbachia load, microfilaremia, antigenemia, and frequency of FDS were significantly reduced in microfilaremic patients up to 24 mo in the doxycycline group compared to the placebo group. The mean dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels in doxycycline-treated patients was reduced significantly at 24 mo, whereas there was no improvement in the placebo group. Preceding clinical improvement, at 12 mo, the mean plasma levels of VEGF-C and sVEGFR-3 decreased significantly in the doxycycline-treated patients to a level close to that of endemic normal values, whereas there was no significant reduction in the placebo patients. The extent of disease in lymphedema patients significantly improved following doxycycline, with the mean stage of lymphedema in the doxycycline-treated patients being significantly lower compared to placebo patients 12 mo after treatment. The reduction in the stages manifested as better skin texture, a reduction of deep folds, and fewer deep skin folds. In conclusion, a 6-wk regimen of antifilarial treatment with doxycycline against W. bancrofti showed a strong macrofilaricidal activity and reduction in plasma levels of VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3, the latter being associated with amelioration of supratesticular dilated lymphatic vessels and with an improvement of pathology in lymphatic filariasis patients.", "Year": "2006", "Authors": "Debrah, A.Y., Mand, S., Specht, S., Marfo-Debrekyei, Y., Batsa, L., Pfarr, K., Larbi, J., Lawson, B., Taylor, M., Adjei, O., Hoerauf, A.", "Journal": "PLoS Pathogens", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "2(9)", "Pages": "829-843", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020092", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Not matched on Scopus (e.g. Worldwide) but confirmed Open", "Activity - key words": "PC", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_317 Debrah et al 2006 PLOS PATHOGENS Doxycycline reduces VGF and improves pathology LF.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_317_Debrah_et_al_2006_PLOS_PATHOGENS_Doxycycline_reduces_VGF_and_improves_pathology_LF.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_317_Debrah_et_al_2006_PLOS_PATHOGENS_Doxycycline_reduces_VGF_and_improves_pathology_LF.pdf"}, {"ID": "319", "Source Collection": "Fiji", "SiteNum": "733", "HardcopyLocation2020": "", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Assessing Progress in Reducing the At-Risk Population after 13 Years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis", "Description": "In 1997, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution 50.29, committing to the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem, subsequently targeted for 2020.

The model estimates that the number of people currently at risk of infection decreased by 46% to 789 million through 2012.Important progress has been made in the global efforts to eliminate LF, but significant scale-up is required over the next 8 years to reach the 2020 elimination goal.", "Year": "2014", "Authors": "Hooper, P.J., Chu, B.K., Mikhailov, A., Ottesen, E.A., Bradley, M.", "Journal": "PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "8(11)", "Pages": "e3333", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003333", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Open Access", "Activity - key words": "LF activities", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_319 Hooper et al 2014 PLOS NTDs Assessing Progress in Reducing the At-Risk Population after 13 Years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_319_Hooper_et_al_2014_PLOS_NTDs_Assessing_Progress_in_Reducing_the_At-Risk_Population_after_13_Years_of_the_Global_Programme_to_Eliminate_Lymphatic_Filariasis.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_319_Hooper_et_al_2014_PLOS_NTDs_Assessing_Progress_in_Reducing_the_At-Risk_Population_after_13_Years_of_the_Global_Programme_to_Eliminate_Lymphatic_Filariasis.pdf"}, {"ID": "332", "Source Collection": "Fiji", "SiteNum": "NA", "HardcopyLocation2020": "WHO DPS FIJI", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "1394", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Laboratory and field evaluation of a new rapid test for detecting Wuchereria bancrofti antigen in human blood", "Description": "Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) guidelines call for using filarial antigen testing to identify endemic areas that require mass drug administration (MDA) and for post-MDA surveillance.

The pre-experimental microfilarial infection rate and mean density in 20 c.mm. were 12.2 per cent. and 4.05. The follow-up (4th) survey included 1430 people. The microfilarial infection rate had risen from 2.7 per cent. to 5.5 per cent. in 4 years. The mean microfilarial density had risen from 0.36 to 0.50. For 507 people present at all four blood surveys the corresponding rates rose from 1.2 per cent. to 6.9 per cent. (originally 16.0 per cent.) and from 0.012 to 0.51 (originally 7.08). It is concluded that disease transmission on a significant scale is unlikely to have resumed yet. When known positive cases are considered alone, the proportion not cured by treatment with two courses of drugs appears to have risen from 7 per cent. to 35 per cent. in the 4 years since treatment. It is known, however, that about 40 per cent. of those apparently cured were still harbouring microfilariae in numbers too small for detection by the routine method used, and there has not been any significant increase in the true infection rate. The records of individual subjects show that some had become positive but these were balanced by others who had become negative. The mean mf.d. had, however, increased about 30 times. The pre-treatment mean microfilarial density among those cured by either one or two courses of drug was very highly significantly lower than among those not cured.

Microfilariae (mf) were counted every hour for 24 h for 6 volunteers and every hour for 12 h (from 18:00 to 06:00) for 16 volunteers. At the same time as the preparation of mf test slides, indoor human landing catches of the vector mosquito, Anopheles farauti, were conducted to assess the vector biting activity. The time of peak microfilaraemia was 01:32 and the microfilarial periodicity index was 112.3, confirming the nocturnal periodicity of Wuchereria bancrofti in Vanuatu.

This paper presents baseline data on microfilaraemia, oedema and acute episodes from a drug trial against bancroftian filariasis in Papua New Guinea. Among 2,187 people with data on these manifestations, 1,144 were microfilaraemic, 78 had leg oedema, 356 had acute episodes and 919 were negative for all three. All possible combinations of the three manifestations were observed. The relationships between microfilaraemia and disease are found to be time-dependent. Microfilaraemia is a positive risk factor for leg oedema at lower ages, but a negative one at higher ages. Acute disease over a whole year is found to be positively associated with a point estimate of microfilaraemia. However, when considering incidence within a month of the time of the blood sample, a curvilinear relationship is found and people with low but positive microfilarial counts have the lowest incidence.

Mean levels generally increased with age in both sexes, with a tendency to plateau at the highest ages. However, there was a reduction among women of approximately reproductive age. Allowing for the tendency for aggregation to decrease with age, this reduction was statistically significant.

Herein, we present data evaluating the interaction between Wuchereria bancrofti and Anopheles punctulatus in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Our field studies in PNG demonstrated that An. punctulatus utilizes the melanization immune response as a natural mechanism of filarial worm resistance against invading W. bancrofti microfilariae. We then conducted laboratory studies utilizing the mosquitoes Armigeres subalbatus and Aedes aegypti and the parasites Brugia malayi, Brugia pahangi, Dirofilaria immitis, and Plasmodium gallinaceum to evaluate the hypothesis that immune activation and/or development by filarial worms negatively impact Plasmodium development in co-infected mosquitoes. Ar. subalbatus used in this study are natural vectors of P. gallinaceum and B. pahangi and they are naturally refractory to B. malayi (melanization-based refractoriness). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mosquitoes were dissected and Plasmodium development was analyzed six days after blood feeding on either P. gallinaceum alone or after taking a bloodmeal containing both P. gallinaceum and B. malayi or a bloodmeal containing both P. gallinaceum and B. pahangi. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence and mean intensity of Plasmodium infections in two species of mosquito that had dual infections as compared to those mosquitoes that were infected with Plasmodium alone, and was independent of whether the mosquito had a melanization immune response to the filarial worm or not. However, there was no reduction in Plasmodium development when filarial worms were present in the bloodmeal (D. immitis) but midgut penetration was absent, suggesting that factors associated with penetration of the midgut by filarial worms likely are responsible for the observed reduction in malaria parasite infections. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results could have an impact on vector infection and transmission dynamics in areas where Anopheles transmit both parasites, i.e., the elimination of filarial worms in a co-endemic locale could enhance malaria transmission.", "Year": "2011", "Authors": "Aliota, M.T., Chen, C.-C., Dagoro, H., Fuchs, J.F., Christensen, B.M.", "Journal": "PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "5(2)", "Pages": "e963", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000963", "Work_Location": "Papua New Guinea", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Open Access", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Papua New Guinea", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_447 Aliota et al 2011 PLOS NTD LF and malaria transmssion PNG out.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_447_Aliota_et_al_2011_PLOS_NTD_LF_and_malaria_transmssion_PNG_out.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_447_Aliota_et_al_2011_PLOS_NTD_LF_and_malaria_transmssion_PNG_out.pdf"}, {"ID": "448", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "207", "HardcopyLocation2020": "", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Reactive oxygen species production and Brugia pahangi survivorship in Aedes polynesiensis with artificial Wolbachia infection types", "Description": "Heterologous transinfection with the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia has been shown previously to induce pathogen interference phenotypes in mosquito hosts. Here we examine an artificially infected strain of Aedes polynesiensis, the primary vector of Wuchereria bancrofti, which is the causative agent of Lymphatic filariasis (LF) throughout much of the South Pacific. Embryonic microinjection was used to transfer the wAlbB infection from Aedes albopictus into an aposymbiotic strain of Ae. polynesiensis. The resulting strain (designated \"MTB\") experiences a stable artificial infection with high maternal inheritance. Reciprocal crosses of MTB with naturally infected wild-type Ae. polynesiensis demonstrate strong bidirectional incompatibility. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the MTB strain differ significantly relative to that of the wild-type, indicating an impaired ability to regulate oxidative stress. Following a challenge with Brugia pahangi, the number of filarial worms achieving the infective stage is significantly reduced in MTB as compared to the naturally infected and aposymbiotic strains. Survivorship of MTB differed significantly from that of the wild-type, with an interactive effect between survivorship and blood feeding. The results demonstrate a direct correlation between decreased ROS levels and decreased survival of adult female Aedes polynesiensis. The results are discussed in relation to the interaction of Wolbachia with ROS production and antioxidant expression, iron homeostasis and the insect immune system.

Proportions of mosquitoes with malaria circumsporozoite antigens diminished with increasing altitude, as did the proportion of mosquitoes infected with stage 3 larvae of Wuchereria bancrofti. These patterns are consistent with increases in the length of the extrinsic incubation period associated with the lower temperatures found at higher altitudes. Inoculation rates varied less regularly with altitude, owing to local variation in biting rates, but were sufficient even at the higher elevations to maintain a high parasite prevalence in the human population.

The group is comprised of 12 cryptic species that require DNA-based tools for species identification. From 1984 to 1998 surveys were carried out in northern Australia, Papua New Guinea and on islands in the southwest Pacific to determine the distribution of the A. punctulatus group. The results of these surveys have now been completed and have generated distribution data from more than 1500 localities through this region. Within this region several climatic and geographical barriers were identified that restricted species distribution and gene flow between geographic populations. This information was further assessed in light of a molecular phylogeny derived from the ssrDNA (18S). Subsequently, hypotheses have been generated on the evolution and distribution of the group so that future field and laboratory studies may be approached more systematically. This study suggested that the ability for widespread dispersal was found to have appeared independently in species that show niche-specific habitat preference (Anopheles farauti s.s. and A. punctulatus) and conversely in species that showed diversity in their larval habitat (Anopheles farauti 2). Adaptation to the monsoonal climate of northern Australia and southwest Papua New Guinea was found to have appeared independently in A. farauti s.s., A. farauti 2 and Anopheles farauti 3.

The biting habit of sporozoite-infected A. punctulatus was also investigated. The sporozoite rates for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were 1.8 and 1.4% respectively, but only one (1.3%) of 76 females infected with P. falciparum was caught between 18:00 and 21:00. A significantly higher proportion (11.6%) of mosquitoes infected with P. vivax was caught in the same period. The late biting habit of mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum is discussed in relation to the differential biting habits of parous and nulliparous females. We conclude with a hypothesis that, in areas where Anopheles mosquitoes have a late-biting cycle and low parous rate, exposure to mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum during the pre-bedtime period (18:00-22:00) is very low. This hypothesis could explain why insecticide-treated bed nets protect children better in areas of seasonal transmission, where nulliparous females tend to predominate, than in areas of perennial transmission, where parous females are usually more numerous.

This study compares one year post-treatment W. bancrofti infection rates of Anopheles punctulatus, the main vector of lymphatic filariasis in Papua New Guinea, using traditional dissection techniques and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based ELISA of a parasite-specific Ssp I repeat. A total of 633 mosquitoes in 35 batches were dissected. Six batches contained W. bancrofti-infected mosquitoes, giving a minimum infection rate of 0.9%. This value was not different than the actual infection rate, which was 9 (1.4%) of 633 mosquitoes (P = 0.48). The DNA was extracted from 47 pools containing a mean of 13.2 mosquitoes per pool. A total of 621 mosquitoes were processed for the PCR-ELISA, including 486 caught by human bait and 135 by light trap, which included both dead and live mosquitoes. Of 23 pools of alcohol-preserved human-bait mosquitoes, seven were positive by the PCR-ELISA, giving an infection rate identical to that obtained by dissection of individual mosquitoes (1.4%). The minimum infection rates for pools of light-trap mosquitoes found dead and alive were 2.7% (2 of 74) and 4.9% (3 of 61), respectively. These values did not differ from each other (P = 0.84), but the overall infection rate of light-trap mosquitoes was greater than that of mosquitoes captured by human bait (3.7% versus 1.4%; P = 0.09). These data indicate that the PCR-ELISA of a W. bancrofti Ssp I repeat using pools of mosquitoes is comparable to traditional dissection techniques for monitoring transmission intensity following introduction of mass chemotherapy.

In a village where mass treatment had been given, using 400 mu g/kg ivermectin plus 6 mg/kg diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC), we performed pre- and post-treatment collections of freshly blood-engorged mosquitoes from the same nine bedrooms. All blood-fed mosquitoes collected less than 4 days after mass treatment died within 9 days, whereas 67% of those collected before treatment survived for > 9 days. Comparison (using the log-rank test) of the survival curves for mosquitoes collected (i) before treatment, (ii) < 4 days after treatment, and (iii) 28 days after treatment, showed the survival rate of group (ii) to be significantly lower than the other two (chi(2) = 176, df = 2, P < 0.0001). Pre- and post-treatment all-night landing catches showed no reduction in human biting rates in the experimental village. In another village, where people were mass treated with ivermectin (400 mu g/kg) only, the survival rates of freshly blood-engorged An.punctulatus collected from bedroom resting-sites less than 1 day after treatment, were compared to similar collections carried out at the same time in a nearby village where people were not treated with ivermectin, The 48-h survival rate for the ivermectin-treated village was 31% compared to 94% for the other; this difference was highly significant (chi(2) = 32.42, df = 1, P < 0.0001). Mosquitoes fed 2 months post-treatment with DEC or collected 38 days post-treatment with ivermectin had normal survival rates.

Papua New Guinea is one of the most populous countries in this region, and 39% of its residents are estimated to be infected with Wuchereria bancrofti. The Ministries of Health of the 22 islands and territories in the Pacific region are committed to taking action against lymphatic filariasis. Accordingly, a regional collaborative effort aimed at the control of filariasis has been organized under the auspices of a program referred to as PacELF. The main objective of PacELF is to eliminate filariasis as public health problem in the Pacific region by the year 2010, 10 years before global elimination of this infectious disease has been targeted. This contribution describes the epidemiology and ecological features of filariasis and prospects for its elimination in Papua New Guinea. The frequencies of microfilaremia, chronic lymphatic disease, and acute filarial morbidity in Papua New Guinea are higher than in many other endemic countries of the Pacific, Africa, and South America. All possible combinations of these three manifestations of filariasis exist. They occur independently of each other, and there is no association between chronic lymphatic disease and microfilarial status. Anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes are the main vectors throughout the country. Transmission intensity is heterogeneous and a major determinant of local patent infection and morbidity rates. Annual transmission potential and annual infective biting rates are positively associated with the village-specific microfilarial rate, mean intensity of microfilaremia, and prevalence of leg edema. Children and adults have similar worm burdens, assessed by circulating filarial antigen levels, in areas of high transmission, whereas worm burdens increase with age in areas of lower transmission. Intensity of exposure to infective third-stage larvae (L3) is significantly correlated with filarial antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production, possibly by a mechanism that alters APC function. Historical evidence suggests that residual insecticide spraying conducted for malaria control in some parts of the country interrupted transmission of W. bancrofti as it did in the Solomon Islands.

Of 53 studies from Africa, South East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and The Americas, 43 showed a lower mean prevalence of infection in females than in males. Prevalence is consistently lower in women of reproductive age and this is statistically significant in 16 of 32 studies classified by age and sex. Density of infection is also lower in the reproductive age but may be higher in children and in older women. Clinical disease is also lower in women and pathology has a later age of onset and rise to peak prevalence than in males. The paper assesses the evidence that lower rates of infection and clinical pathology are due to less exposure of females to infective vectors. It seems unlikely that exposure alone could account for these differences which are observed for both bancroftian and brugian filariasis, irrespective of periodicity. Several investigators have suggested that females have increased resistance to infection and this is supported by serological studies showing high antibody positivity to adult worm antigens in females. The review concludes that the association with the reproductive years suggests a pregnancy-associated mechanism.

An improved understanding of the mosquito population genetics is needed for insight into the population dynamics and dispersal, which can aid in understanding the epidemiology of disease transmission and control of the vector. In light of the potential release of a Wolbachia infected strain for vector control, our objectives were to investigate the microgeographical and temporal population genetic structure of A. polynesiensis within the Society Islands of French Polynesia, and to compare the genetic background of a laboratory strain intended for release into its population of origin. METHODS: A panel of eight microsatellite loci were used to genotype A. polynesiensis samples collected in French Polynesia from 2005-2008 and introgressed A. polynesiensis and Aedes riversi laboratory strains. Examination of genetic differentiation was performed using F-statistics, STRUCTURE, and an AMOVA. BAYESASS was used to estimate direction and rates of mosquito movement. RESULTS: FST values, AMOVA, and STRUCTURE analyses suggest low levels of intra-island differentiation from multiple collection sites on Tahiti, Raiatea, and Maupiti. Significant pair-wise FST values translate to relatively minor levels of inter-island genetic differentiation between more isolated islands and little differentiation between islands with greater commercial traffic (i.e., Tahiti, Raiatea, and Moorea). STRUCTURE analyses also indicate two population groups across the Society Islands, and the genetic makeup of Wolbachia infected strains intended for release is similar to that of wild-type populations from its island of origin, and unlike that of A. riversi. CONCLUSIONS: The observed panmictic population on Tahiti, Raiatea, and Moorea is consistent with hypothesized gene flow occurring between islands that have relatively high levels of air and maritime traffic, compared to that of the more isolated Maupiti and Tahaa.

As part of current global campaign, mass drug administration (MDA) has effectively reduced lymphatic filiariasis prevalence, but mosquito vector biology can complicate the MDA strategy. In some regions, there is evidence that the goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone. Obligate vector mosquitoes provide additional targets for breaking the LF transmission cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector throughout much of the South Pacific, Aedes polynesiensis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in an A. polynesiensis strain ('CP' strain) that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays demonstrate that CP males are equally competitive, resulting in population elimination when CP males are introduced into wild type A. polynesiensis populations.

This is largely due to the difficulty of finding an adequate and unbiased sample of resting, engorged mosquitoes to enable the identification of host blood meal sources. This is particularly difficult in the south-west Pacific countries of Indonesia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea where thick vegetation constitutes the primary resting sites for the exophilic mosquitoes that are the primary malaria and filariasis vectors. METHODS: Barrier screens of shade-cloth netting attached to bamboo poles were constructed between villages and likely areas where mosquitoes might seek blood meals or rest. Flying mosquitoes, obstructed by the barrier screens, would temporarily stop and could then be captured by aspiration at hourly intervals throughout the night. RESULTS: In the three countries where this method was evaluated, blood-fed females of Anopheles farauti, Anopheles bancroftii, Anopheles longirostris, Anopheles sundaicus, Anopheles vagus, Anopheles kochi, Anopheles annularis, Anopheles tessellatus, Culex vishnui, Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia spp were collected while resting on the barrier screens. In addition, female Anopheles punctulatus and Armigeres spp as well as male An. farauti, Cx. vishnui, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Aedes species were similarly captured.

Here, we review these processes operating in filarial infections and show their impact on the persistence of the parasite, as well as pointing out those issues where more information is required to develop sound predictions about the eradicability of these infections.", "Year": "2005", "Authors": "Duerr, H.-P., Dietz, K., Eichner, M.", "Journal": "Trends in Parasitology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "21(2)", "Pages": "88-96", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2004.11.011", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Pacific", "Access_Rights": "Open via Publisher", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "biting, transmission, control", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_550 Duerr et al 2005 TIP Eradicability of LF.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "download_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2004.11.011"}, {"ID": "552", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "263", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "77; 1395", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Surgical management of morbidity due to lymphatic filariasis: the usefulness of a standardized international clinical classification of hydroceles", "Description": "The objective of this work is to evaluate the usefulness of a standardized clinical classification of hydroceles in lymphatic filariasis endemic countries to guide their surgical management. 64 patients with hydroceles were operated in 2009-2010, in Level II hospitals (WHO classification), during two visits to Fiji, by the same mobile surgical team. The number of hydroceles treated was 83. We developed and evaluated a much needed clinical classification of hydroceles based on four criteria: Type (uni/bilateral); Side (left/right); Stage of enlargement of the scrotum rated from I to VI; Grade of burial of the penis rated from 0 to 4. It lead to the conclusion that 1) A Stage I or II hydrocele, associated with Grade 0 or 1 penis burial could be considered a \"Simple Hydrocele\". The surgical treatment is simple with no anticipated early complication. WHO Level II of health care structure seems adapted. 2) A Stage III or IV hydrocele associated with Grade 2, 3 or 4 penis burial could be considered a \"Complicated Hydrocele\". The operation is longer, more complicated and the possibility of occurrence of complications seems greater. A level III health care facility would be more adapted under the normal functioning of the health system. We conclude that a standardized clinical classification of hydroceles based on the Stage of enlargement of the scrotum and the Grade of burial of the penis appears to be a useful tool to guide the decision about the level of care and the surgical technique required. We use the same classification for penoscrotal lymphoedema. A decision tree is presented for the management of hydroceles in lymphatic filariasis endemic countries which could usefully complement the \"Algorithm for management of scrotal swelling\" proposed by WHO in 2002.

Forty male microfilariae (mf) carriers between 18 and 50 years of age, in whom mf density was greater than or equal to 20 mf/ml, were treated twice at a one-year interval. Twelve months after the second treatment, in carriers who were given a dose greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/kg, mean mf density was 4-7% of the initial pretreatment mf density. Therefore, several successive annual treatments with single doses greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/kg of ivermectin should result in reducing mf densities to a very low level. Nevertheless, at 9 months after the second treatment, residual parasitaemia ranged from 1 to 2182 mf/ml (median 85) in 30 patients. Finally, in patients with pretreatment mf counts less than or equal to 150 mf/ml, mean mf density was 2.8 and 8.9 mf/ml, respectively, during the 2 six-month periods following treatment, while in patients with pretreatment mf densities greater than 150 mf/ml (median 1500) it was 92.3 and 334.1 mf/ml during the same periods.

Despite decades of ongoing mass drug administration (MDA) in the region, some island nations have not yet achieved the threshold levels of microfilaremia established by the World Health Organization for eliminating transmission. Previously, the generation of a novel Aedes polynesiensis strain (CP) infected with an exogenous type of Wolbachia has been described. The CP mosquito is cytoplasmically incompatible (i.e., effectively sterile) when mated with wildtype mosquitoes, and a strategy was proposed for the control of A. polynesiensis populations by repeated, inundative releases of CP males to disrupt fertility of wild females. Such a strategy could lead to suppression of the vector population and subsequently lead to a reduction in the transmission of filarial worms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CP males and F1 male offspring from wild-caught A. polynesiensis females exhibit near equal mating competitiveness with F1 females under semi-field conditions.

Following the World Health Assembly resolution in 1997, the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched. In the Pacific, the World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented from 1999, the Pacific Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PacELF) bringing together the 22 countries and territories, in a common effort to eliminate the disease. The strategy is based on Mass Drug Administration (MDA); in annual single dose during 5 years of a Diethycarbamazine/Albendazole association distributed to all the population at risk. Among the 22 countries and territories of the Pacific, 16 are endemic and 6 are non endemic. The classification is based according to the filarian antigen prevalence upper or lower than 1%. MDA are decided when the rate of the filarian antigen prevalence is > 1%. The objective of PacELF is to reduce this rate down to < 1%, threshold under which the transmission is supposed to be stopped. From 1999 to 2007, 14 of the 16 endemic countries organized MDA. Eleven of them completed the cycle of 5 treatments and even beyond. But, these MDA reached only 19% of the at risk population, because of logistic difficulties in Papua New Guinea, the most populated country in the Pacific. The investigations carried out in sentinel sites showed a public health impact, by the fall of the number of microfilaria carriers, often down to a rate < 1%. However the rate of circulating antigen prevalence remains often above the required threshold of 1%. Prevalence surveys carried out in 2007, in different endemic countries, revealed the necessity to intensify efforts and to refine strategy for elimination of FL from the Pacific. A lot of progress were obtained, but few problems were identified. Reflexions are imperative and in progress about: the MDA coverage rates while at the same time a certain lassitude appears in the populations and among health staff, the methods to evaluate the effectiveness of MDA, the reliability of the diagnostic tools to decide of the stop of MDA and to certify the absence of the transmission, the relevance of univocal biological criteria for the whole Pacific area, the need for an active surveillance during several years after stopping MDA, particularly in the countries affected by the very efficient vector Aedes polynesiensis. Seven years after its launching, despite undeniable success, the PacELF program did not achieve its very ambitious goal of stopping the transmission. Three years before its term, strong efforts have to be done and additional strategies be implemented. However; it is reasonable to expect the prolongation of the program in order to achieve the final objective.

A total of 22,970 mosquitoes were individually assessed using a Plasmodium sporozoite enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to identify Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae circumsporozoite proteins. All mosquitoes were identified to species by morphology and/or PCR. Based on distribution, abundance and their ability to develop sporozoites, we identified five species as major vectors of malaria in PNG. These included: Anopheles farauti, Anopheles hinesorum (incriminated here, to our knowledge, for the first time), Anopheles farauti 4, Anopheles koliensis and Anopheles punctulatus. Anopheles longirostris and Anopheles bancroftii were also incriminated in this study. Surprisingly, An. longirostris showed a high incidence of infections in some areas. A newly identified taxon within the Punctulatus Group, tentatively called An. farauti 8, was also found positive for circumsporozoite protein. These latter three species, together with Anopheles karwari and Anopheles subpictus, incriminated in other studies, appear to be only minor vectors, while Anopheles farauti 6 appears to be the major vector in the highland river valleys (>1500 m above sea level).

METHODS: Using variance-component analysis, we examined the contribution of shared genetic and environmental effects on host clinical and immune responses to filarial infection, along with potential confounding determinants. RESULTS: Sex was found to have a negligible influence on heritability estimates, but shared-household effects accounted for up to 32% of host variability. After accounting for these shared-household effects, heritability estimates suggested that levels of microfilariae and circulating adult worm antigen, as well as host eosinophil and immunoglobulin G antibody responses to larval and adult worm antigens, were highly heritable (range of heritability estimates, 0.15-0.84).

As the global prevalence of infection was not known in New Caledonia (NC), a serosurvey study was conducted by determining the prevalence of circulating filarial antigens, as recommended by the World Health Organization. FINDINGS: A cross sectional study on a 2 degree stratified sample was carried out from June to November 2013. Inclusion criteria were: individuals aged 2 to 80 y/o, who had been hospitalized or sought medical care for a non-infectious cause and who had been living in NC for more than 6 months.

The overall LF antigenic prevalence was 0.62% (CI 95% [0.60-0.63]). All patients were unrelated to each other; none of them presented clinical symptoms of LF. Four of the 7 ICT positive patients reported having travelled to LF endemic areas, 2 patients had never traveled outside NC and the last one had only traveled in non-endemic areas.

This paper describes results of a longitudinal study of changes in levels of PC-Ag in response to diethylcarbamazine (DEC) therapy as measured by two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and Western blotting. One hundred thirty-two residents of a bancroftian filariasis-endemic area of Papua New Guinea (PNG) were treated with a 72 mg/kg dose of DEC. A macrofilaricidal effect was seen with this dose of DEC as 34% of the treated subjects had localized side effects and long-term decreases in microfilariae (mf) counts were observed 12 months after treatment. The PC-Ag levels were reduced to 72%, 52%, and 51% of pretreatment values at 21 days and at six and 12 months after treatment. These decreases, observed by IRMA, were specifically associated with loss of the Mr 200,000 PC-Ag detected by immunoadsorption and Western blotting. From drug treatment data, the maximum half-life of PC-Ag in circulation was calculated to be 50 days, assuming a first-order decay process.

Anophelines are generally characterized as poor vectors due to an inability to support development at low densities. However, it is important to understand the potential for transmission in natural vectors to maximize the success of elimination efforts. Primary vectors in Papua New Guinea (n = 1209) were dissected following exposure to microfilaremic blood (range 8-233 mf/20 microl). We examined density dependent and species-specific parasite prevalence, intensity and yield, barriers to parasite development as well as impacts on mosquito survival. We observed strikingly different parasite prevalence and yield among closely related species. Prevalence of infective stage larvae (L3s) ranged from 4.2% to 23.7% in An. punctulatus, 24.5% to 68.6% in An. farauti s.s. and 61.9% to 100% in An. hinesorum at low and high density exposures, respectively. Injection experiments revealed the greatest barrier to parasite development involved passage from the midgut into the hemocoel. The ratio of L3 to ingested mf at low densities was higher in An. hinesorum (yield = 1.0) and An. farauti s.s. (yield = 0.5) than has been reported in other anopheline vectors. There was a negative relationship between mosquito survival and bloodmeal mf density. In An. farauti s.s., increased parasite yield and survival at low densities suggest greater competence at low microfilaremias.

Examples in French Polynesia]", "Description": "[Some pathogens are known to be transmitted to humans by hematophagous insects. Control of diseases caused by arthropod-borne pathogens has usually been carried out by vector control using insecticides. The response of many vectors to insecticidal pressures often results in selection of resistant populations. Under field conditions, resistance is usually controlled by genes. Susceptibility or resistance to pathogens are usually determined by relatively simple genetic mechanisms. The frequency of such genes within a population will be influenced by evolutionary forces and interpopulation differences in levels of susceptibility to pathogens can be estimated. In view to understand the evolution of selected traits (insecticide resistance or vector capacity), analyses of gene flow provide information on population local dispersion patterns which is critical in vector control, indicating the distance of dispersal of vectors. Given that mosquitoes colonize various restricted and differentiated habitats, studies of mosquito populations appear especially promising for the understanding of vector genetic structure, vector transmission, disease epidemiology and disease control. Knowledge of patterns of gene flow and dispersal rates are useful to define geographic structure of mosquito populations from French Polynesia in relation with the transmission of a parasite (Bancroftian filariasis worm) or a virus (dengue viruses) or with their capacity to resist to insecticides. (1) Experimental infections of various geographic strains of Aedes polynesiensis for Wuchereria bancrofti show differences in the vectorial efficiency related to the geographic origin of the mosquito strain. Mosquitoes were more efficient intermediate hosts when infected with sympatric W. bancrofti. Mosquito strains from the Society archipelago developed the highest proportion of infective stage larvae and exhibited the lowest mortality rate. Isoenzyme frequency differences among Ae. polynesiensis populations confirms the genetic divergence of geographic isolated populations from crab holes. (2) A study on the genetic structure of Aedes aegypti, a vector of dengue viruses, shows a low level of genetic exchanges between mosquito populations. Genetic differentiation is probably due to insecticidal pressure which tends to structure mosquitoes for their oral susceptibility to dengue type 2 virus. The occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fryer in French Polynesia during the last few years was likely due to the dispersal of dengue viruses via viremic people rather than via infected vectors. (3) The analysis of the distribution of insecticide resistance genes in relation to genetic structure and gene now in Culex quinquefasciatus show that the frequency of resistance genes to organophosphorous insecticides is correlated to human displacements.

Here, we examine the empirical evidence for this hypothesis and its implications for the global elimination of the major macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis, by applying a novel Bayesian computer simulation procedure to fit a dynamic model of the transmission of this parasitic disease to field data from nine villages with different ecological and geographical characteristics. Baseline lymphatic filariasis microfilarial age-prevalence data from three geographically distinct endemic regions, across which the major vector populations implicated in parasite transmission also differed, were used to fit and calibrate the relevant vector-specific filariasis transmission models.

A six-country study was conducted assessing the performance of seven diagnostic tests, including tests for microfilariae (blood smear, PCR), parasite antigen (ICT, Og4C3) and antifilarial antibody (Bm14, PanLF, Urine SXP). One community survey and one school survey were performed in each country.

We describe a new technique that can provide data comparable to those obtained by individual dissection, including calculation of infection and infective rates, and this technique is easy enough to accommodate large numbers of insects. Brief treatment of ethanol-fixed, intact mosquitoes in sodium hypochlorite, followed by treatments in increasing concentrations of ethanol and an organic solvent allowed microscopic visualization of filarial larvae within the abdomen, thorax, head, and proboscis of Brugia malayi-infected Aedes aegypti and Wuchereria bancrofti-infected Anopheles punctulatus.

The theoretical analysis examines the relationship between microfilarial burdens and the prevalence of adult (macrofilarial) worms in the human host population. The main finding is that a large proportion of observed mf-negatives may be 'true' zeros, arising from the absence of macrofilarial infections or unmated adult worms, rather than being attributable to the blood sampling process. The corresponding mf distribution should then follow a Poisson mixture, arising from the sampling of mf positives, with an additional proportion of 'true' mf-zeros. This hypothesis is supported by analysis of observed Wuchereria bancrofti mf distributions from Southern India, Japan and Fiji, in which zero-truncated Poisson mixtures fit mf-positive counts more effectively than distributions including the observed zeros. The fits of two Poisson mixtures, the negative binomial and the Sichel distribution, are compared. The Sichel provides a slightly better empirical description of the mf density distribution; reasons for this improvement, and a discussion of the relative merits of the two distributions, are presented.

The persistence of transmission may be partly related to the highly efficient Aedes vectors. The assessment of pathogen transmission by mosquito vectors and of vector control relies on the ability to capture mosquitoes efficiently. The aims of this study are to compare trapping methods to capture LF-infected mosquitoes and determine the role in transmission of the species of Aedes mosquitoes in the area. METHODS: Fasitoo-Tai village was the chosen site because of persistent transmission despite annual mass drug administration. Sampling methods included BioGents Sentinel (BGS) trap, human-baited collections (HBC) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) trap. BGS and CDC traps were baited with BG-lure, CO2, and/or octenol. Individual trap locations were geo-located and efficiency of sampling methods was evaluated using a randomized Latin-square design in two locations. Number of mosquitoes collected (male and female), as well as species for each trapping method were determined. Additionally, Ae. polynesiensis and Ae. (Finlaya) spp. females were pooled by trap method and analysed for filarial DNA. Infection prevalence was estimated using the PoolScreen software. RESULTS: The BGS trap with any type of bait collected more mosquitoes compared to both the CDC trap and the HBC. The BGS trap baited with BG-lure collected more mosquitoes than with CO2 and octenol. There were no significant differences between trapping methods in terms of proportions of infected females collected. The prevalence of filarial infection in Ae. polynesiensis and Ae. (Finlaya) spp. was estimated at 4.7% and 0.67% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of the BGS trap for research on and surveillance of the mosquito vectors of LF in Samoa. The BGS trap is a suitable and safer alternative to HBC for sampling Ae. polynesiensis and Ae. (Finlaya) spp., which continue to be the predominant vectors of LF.

This represented 66.3% of the village population. Blood was collected between 22:00 and 03:00 by finger-prick and made into thick smears to detect microfilaria and collected onto filter paper for W. bancrofti antigen tests. A second group of 110 specimens was similarly collected from residents of the Hospital campus and inpatients. W. bancrofti antigen was tested for using the Trop-Bio Og4C3 test. RESULTS: One sample (1/307) from an 18 year old male from Alsai was positive for W. bancrofti antigen. No samples were positive for microfilaria. Although antigen-positivity indicated a live worm, the case was regarded as having been acquired some years previously. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that when LF has been eliminated from a country, a case of elephantiasis should be a trigger to conduct a survey of the case's community using a decision pathway. W. bancrofti antigen should be tested for with screening for microfilariae in antigen positive cases.

The total data set comprises 90,635 subject exposures and includes individuals of all ages and both genders. Results are presented for hospital-based studies, laboratory studies, active surveillance of microfilaria-positive and microfilaria-negative individuals, and passive monitoring in both community-based studies and mass treatment programmes of individuals treated with albendazole (n = 1538), ivermectin (9822), DEC (576), albendazole + ivermectin (7470), albendazole + DEC (69,020), or placebo (1144). The most rigorous monitoring, which includes haematological and biochemical laboratory parameters pre- and post-treatment, provides no evidence that consistent changes are induced by any treatment; the majority of abnormalities appear to be sporadic, and the addition of albendazole to either ivermectin or DEC does not increase the frequency of abnormalities. Both DEC and ivermectin show, as expected, an adverse event profile compatible with the destruction of microfilariae. The addition of albendazole to either single-drug treatment regimen does not appear to increase the frequency or intensity of events seen with these microfilaricidal drugs when used alone. Direct observations indicated that the level of adverse events, both frequency and intensity, was correlated with the level of microfilaraemia. In non microfilaraemic individuals, who form 80-90% of the 'at risk' populations to be treated in most national public health programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF), the event profile with the compounds alone or in combination does not differ significantly from that of placebo. Data on the use of ivermectin + albendazole in areas either of double infection (onchocerciasis and LF), or of loiais (with or without concurrent LF) are still inadequate and further studies are needed.

The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis aims to eliminate LF as a public health problem by the year 2020, primarily through repeated Mass Drug Administration (MDA). The Pacific region programme commenced in 1999. By June 2007, five of the eleven countries classified as endemic had completed five MDA campaigns and post-MDA prevalence surveys to assess their progress. We review available programme data and discuss their implications for other LF elimination programs in developing countries. METHODS: Reported MDA coverage and results from initial surveys and post-MDA surveys of LF using the immunochromatographic test (ICT) from these five Pacific Island countries (Tonga, Niue, Vanuatu, Samoa and Cook Islands) were analysed to provide an understanding of their quality and programme progress towards LF elimination. Denominator data reported by each country programme for 2001 was compared to official sources to assess the accuracy of MDA coverage data. RESULTS: Initial survey results from these five countries revealed an ICT prevalence of between 2.7 and 8.6 percent in individuals tested prior to commencement of the programme. Country MDA coverage results varied depending on the source of denominator data. Of the five countries in this case study, three countries (Tonga, Niue and Vanuatu) reached the target prevalence of <1% antigenaemia following five rounds of MDA. However, endpoint data could not be reliably compared to baseline data as survey methodology varied. CONCLUSION: Accurate and representative baseline and post-campaign prevalence data is crucial for determining program effectiveness and the factors contributing to effectiveness. This is emphasised by the findings of this case study. While three of the five Pacific countries reported achieving the target prevalence of <1% antigenaemia, limitations in the data preclude identification of key determinants of this achievement.", "Year": "2009", "Authors": "Huppatz, C., Capuano, C., Palmer, K., Kelly, P.M., Durrheim, D.N.", "Journal": "BMC Infectious Diseases", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "9", "Pages": "92", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-9-92", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Pacific", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Open Access", "Activity - key words": "MDA, ICT", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Pacific", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_708 Huppatz et al 2009 BMC Inf Dis LF lessons from Pacific.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "Tonga, Niue, Vanuatu, Samoa, Cook Islands", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_708_Huppatz_et_al_2009_BMC_Inf_Dis_LF_lessons_from_Pacific.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_708_Huppatz_et_al_2009_BMC_Inf_Dis_LF_lessons_from_Pacific.pdf"}, {"ID": "711", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "408", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "180; 423", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Lymphatic filariasis elimination in the Pacific: PacELF replicating Japanese success", "Description": "Japan successfully eliminated lymphatic filariasis and other parasitic diseases through community-driven, integrated nationwide campaigns undertaken during the 1960s and 1970s.

LF is recognized as endemic in 73 countries and territories; an estimated 1.39 billion (thousand million) people live in areas where filariasis has been endemic and is now targeted for treatment [1]. Global momentum to eliminate LF has developed over the past 15 years as a result not only of research demonstrating the value of single-dose treatment strategies and point-of-care diagnostic tools, but also of both the generous donations of medicines from the following committed pharmaceutical companies: GlaxoSmithKline (albendazole), Merck (ivermectin), and Eisai (diethylcarbamazine; DEC), and the essential financial support for programme implementation from the donor community [2]. During 2011, more than 50 countries carried out LF elimination programmes, and more than 500 million people received mass treatment [1].

This is challenging in areas where the day-biting Aedes polynesiensis is endemic, such as Samoa, since in previous studies no geographical clustering of infection has been demonstrated. Another challenge for this low prevalence phase is the choice of diagnostic assay as testing for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) or microfilariae (Mf) alone may not have adequate sensitivity. This could be solved by using the commercially available filariasis Cellabs enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA) to measure antibody. In the current study five Samoan villages were chosen based on previous epidemiological assessments to represent a range of infection prevalences. CFA, Mf, and antibody levels in children </= 10 years had been recorded and results linked to household of residence and/or primary school of attendance. To ascertain the location of exposure, two scenarios based on potential foci of transmission around communities and schools were explored. Both scenarios revealed significant spatial clusters of households with infected individuals and a relationship to antibody positive children when they were included in the spatial analysis. Fasitoo-Tai had the highest LF prevalence and largest geographical spatial clusters for both scenarios. In Falefa, spatial clusters were detected only for the primary school scenario. In Tafua, which spanned an area of 19.5 km(2), no spatial clusters were detected. Lastly, in Siufaga, the village with the lowest LF prevalence, significant clustering of infected individuals was observed and, for the primary school scenario, this was geographically related to exposure.

The objective of this study was to assess the parasitological and clinical features of bancroftian filariasis in a community in East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea. In a village of 99 individuals, the overall prevalence of microfilaremia was 68%. The microfilarial carrier rate was high in those less than or equal to 10 years (62%), remained elevated in the 11-20, 21-30, and 31-40 age groups (42-55%), and peaked in subjects greater than or equal to 41 years old (90%).

A systematic review of the published literature was conducted. All studies that contained primary or secondary data on costs or cost-effectiveness of prevention and control were considered. A total of 52 papers were included for LF and 24 papers were included for onchocerciasis. Large research gaps exist on the synergies and cost of integrating NTD prevention and control programs, as well as research on the role of health information systems, human resource systems, service delivery, and essential medicines and technology for elimination. The literature available on costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions is also generally older, extremely focal geographically and of limited usefulness for developing estimates of the global economic burden of these diseases and prioritizing among various intervention options. Up to date information on the costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions for LF and onchocerciasis prevention are needed given the vastly expanded funding base for the control and elimination of these diseases.

Many studies to optimize the dosage and treatment schedule of DEC followed, and, based on the results, control programs with various regimens were implemented in different endemic areas/countries. By the mid 1970s, with endorsement by the WHO Expert Committee on Filariasis (3rd report, 1974), the standard DEC regimen for W. bancrofti infection in mass treatment had been established in principle: a total dose of 72 mg/kg of body weight given in 12 divided doses, once weekly or monthly, at 6 mg/kg each. Not long after the committee report, the efficacy of annual single-dose treatment at 6 mg/kg, which is only one twelfth of the WHO-recommended dose in a year, was reported effective in French Polynesia (study period: 1973-78), and later in Samoa (study period: 1979-81). These results were published between 1978 and 1985 in the Bulletin of WHO but received little attention. In the mid 1980s, the efficacy of ivermectin, the first-choice drug for onchocerciasis, against lymphatic filariae came to light. Since the effect at a single dose was remarkable, and often better than DEC, it was predicted that the newly introduced drug would replace DEC. Treatment experiments with ivermectin increased quickly in number. Meanwhile, annual single-dose mass drug administration (MDA) with DEC at 6 mg/kg was under scrutiny in Samoa and Fiji. In the early 1990s, the Samoan study, which covered the entire population of 160,000 with 3 annual MDAs, reported a significant reduction in microfilaria (mf) prevalence and mean mf density, while in Fiji, the efficacy of 5 rounds of annual MDA (total dose, 30 mg/kg) was shown to be as effective as 28 multi-dose MDA spread over 2 years (6 weekly plus 22 monthly treatments at 5 mg/kg; total dose, 140 mg/kg). Several additional studies carried out in Samoa in relation to the annual single-dose MDAs revealed that low density mf carriers, who have a very low mf count of 1-20/ml of venous blood, could not play a significant role in filariasis transmission.From around 1990, studies on spaced low-dose DEC treatments and various types of combination chemotherapy with DEC and ivermectin increased. Albendazole, a well-known anti-intestinal helminths agent, was later added to the combination. The main findings of these studies with W. bancrofti are: (i) a single dose of DEC at 6 mg/kg reduced mean mf density by ca. 90% 1 year after treatment; (ii) the same dose could damage/kill adult worms; (iii) a single dose of ivermectin at ca. 400 microg/kg was more effective than DEC in reducing mf density during the first year and was similarly or less effective in the second year; (iv) ivermectin probably could not kill adult worms; (v) a single combined dose of albendazole (400 mg) and DEC (6 mg/kg) was effective to reduce mf density by 85 to nearly 100% 12-24 months after treatment; and (vi) ivermectin or albendazole included in the combination chemotherapy produced \"beyond-filariasis\" benefits: clearance/reduction of intestinal helminths, and, additionally, in the case of ivermectin, skin-dwelling ectoparasites.The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) started its worldwide activities in 2000, with the target of elimination by 2020. The basic strategy is to conduct annual single-dose MDAs for 4-6 years. In 2000-2007, a minimum of 570 million individuals were treated in 48 of 83 endemic countries. The drugs used are DEC 6 mg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg in most countries, or ivermectin 200-400 microg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg particularly in onchocerciasis endemic countries in Africa. (MDAs with DEC alone had been used in India.)The GPELF achieved impressive results in terms of parasitological cure/improvement, clinical benefits, social and economic impacts, etc. However, the most impressive result of all was the programme's success in mobilizing hundreds of millions of local people, who not only took drugs but many of them actively supported MDAs as drug distributors and volunteers.

L1 had a U-shaped growth in length, while widths followed an S-shaped function. L2 had an S-shaped growth in length and width. Growth in length of L3 was also S-shaped, while widths had an asymptotic size following a period of rapid shrinkage. The greatest difference between length and width was in stage 3 where the length was over 75 times greater than the width. The ratio of length to width was approximately 50 for microfilariae and only 10 for the L1 ('sausage') stage. Characteristic mean length (and width) were approximately 280(7) microm for microfilariae, approximately 181 microm for L1 at their smallest, and approximately 1584(22) microm for L3 infective larvae. There was a great increase in length during stage 2 from approximately 322(27) to approximately 982(31) microm. Stage duration decreased with increasing temperature while growth rate increased, giving steeper growth curves. There was no effect of temperature on size, except for L3, which were shorter when mosquitoes were reared at higher temperature. It appears that larval growth is a continuous process from microfilariae to the young L3 stage, and continuously modifies the larval parasite aspect, even within each stage. Thus, information on larval shape may be used as an age indicator and in some cases, may give an estimation on time elapsed since infection of the vector. An important demographic parameter used in most mathematical models describing transmission of parasites by insect vectors is the length of the gonotrophic cycle of the vector, i.e. the time interval between two successive blood-meals. Usual methods for computing such a parameter are based on mark-recapture techniques. However, reliable estimates need substantial capture rates, which are not always possible. This paper presents another approach in which marked mosquitoes are those naturally infected by W. bancrofti. For one mosquito, the time since infection is simply the age of the developing larval parasite. Our method first expresses the age of larval parasite as a fraction of total development time (from microfilariae entering the vector to L3 larvae) using a regression model based on measurements of the parasite's length and width. This fraction of development is then converted to a chronological age since infection, using a back-calculation procedure involving ambient temperatures and growth rates of W. bancrofti larvae in the vector. The method is applied to wild caught Ae. polynesiensis in French Polynesia to compute the length of the gonotrophic cycle. This mosquito species comes to bite approximately 3, 6-7 and 9 days after a first infectious blood-meal. Then the length of the gonotrophic cycle may be of 3-4 days.", "Year": "2002", "Authors": "Lardeux, F., Cheffort, J.", "Journal": "International Journal for Parasitology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "32(6)", "Pages": "705-716", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0020-7519(01)00290-9", "Work_Location": "French Polynesia", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "French Polynesia", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_784 Lardeux and Cheffort 2002 Int J Parasitol 1-s2.0-S0020751901002909-main.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "PacELF_784_Lardeux_and_Cheffort_2002_Int_J_Parasitol_1-s2.0-S0020751901002909-main.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_784_Lardeux_and_Cheffort_2002_Int_J_Parasitol_1-s2.0-S0020751901002909-main.txt"}, {"ID": "785", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "482", "HardcopyLocation2020": "", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Wuchereria bancrofti (Filariidea: Dipetalonematidae) and its vector Aedes polynesiensis (Diptera: Culicidae) in a French Polynesian village", "Description": "In March 1991, a study on Wuchereria bancrofti (Cobbold, 1887) infection rates in its vector, Aedes polynesiensis Marks, was carried out in a village of French Polynesia.

We examined the seroprevalence and spatial epidemiology of LF post-MDA to inform strategies for ongoing surveillance and to reduce resurgence risk. METHODS: ELISA for LF antigen (Og4C3) and antibodies (Wb123, Bm14) were performed on a geo-referenced serum bank of 807 adults collected in 2010. Risk factors assessed for association with sero-positivity included age, sex, years lived in American Samoa, and occupation. Geographic clustering of serological indicators was investigated to identify spatial dependence and household-level clustering. RESULTS: Og4C3 antigen of >128 units (positive) were found in 0.75% (95% CI 0.3-1.6%) of participants, and >32 units (equivocal plus positive) in 3.2% (95% CI 0.6-4.7%). Seroprevalence of Wb123 and Bm14 antibodies were 8.1% (95% CI 6.3-10.2%) and 17.9% (95% CI 15.3-20.7%) respectively. Antigen-positive individuals were identified in all ages, and antibody prevalence higher in older ages. Prevalence was higher in males, and inversely associated with years lived in American Samoa. Spatial distribution of individuals varied significantly with positive and equivocal levels of Og4C3 antigen, but not with antibodies. Using Og4C3 cutoff points of >128 units and >32 units, average cluster sizes were 1,242 m and 1,498 m, and geographical proximity of households explained 85% and 62% of the spatial variation respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High-risk populations for LF in American Samoa include adult males and recent migrants. We identified locations and estimated the size of possible residual foci of antigen-positive adults, demonstrating the value of spatial analysis in post-MDA surveillance. Strategies to monitor cluster residents and high-risk groups are needed to reduce resurgence risk.

Analysis of the microfilarial densities at different ages and the number of anatomical sites showing lymph gland enlargement or elephantiasis have been used to provide evidence on the clustering of infections and pathogenesis. Although there is no evidence of clustering of risk of infection, there is evidence favouring the clustering of adult filariae in individuals. Nevertheless the number of sites of lymph node enlargement do not correspond with this finding and statistical evidence suggests that lymph-node enlargement is not necessarily associated with the near presence in the body of adult filariae, whether dead or alive. Males of Indian ethnic origin showed a higher prevalence of elephantiasis than males of Fijian ethnic origin, but women of either ethnic race showed prevalences lower than those of men. The onset of elephantiasis at a site does not directly reflect the number of infections sustained in the local area, but it appears that filariasis first induces for a limited period a proneness to elephantiasis.

Here, we use a combined modelling and comparative data analysis framework to address this issue for human infections with the filarial parasite, Wuchereria bancrofti. By analogy with previous work, the analysis involves the comparison of observed field patterns of infection with epidemiological patterns predicted by a mathematical model of parasite immunity. Unlike most other human helminths, which are transmitted by ingestion or dermal penetration, exposure to infection with lymphatic filariasis can be measured explicitly in terms of vector mosquito biting rates, thereby also allowing, probably for the first time, examination of the suggested role of exposure in generating herd immunity to macroparasites. Observed field patterns in this study were derived from 19 different published studies, which gave parallel estimates of community exposure rates and the corresponding age--prevalence patterns of infection, while predictions of the epidemiological impact of herd immunity were obtained using a catalytic model framework. The results provide the first conclusive evidence to date that variations in the observed age--prevalence patterns of infection in filariasis can be effectively explained by the occurrence of an exposure-driven acquisition of herd immunity.

A method for aggregating and projecting prevalence data from individual studies to national, regional and global levels, which also facilitates the estimation of gender and age-specific burdens, is presented. The method weights in favour of the larger, and hence presumbably more reliable, studies and relies on estimated empirical relationships between gender, age, infection and disease in order to correct studies with incomplete data. The results presented here suggest that although the overall prevalence of filariasis cases is 2.0% globally (approximately totalling 119 million cases), the disease continues to be of considerable local importance, particularly in India and Sub-Saharan Africa. Estimates by age and gender clearly show that, unlike other helminth infections, filariasis is mainly a disease of the adult and older age-classes and appears to be more prevalent in males. This work suggests that the derivation of more accurate estimates of the burden of filariasis will require a better understanding of both the epidemiology and the spatial aspects of infection and disease.

We used a combined analysis of empirical community data describing the association between infection and chronic disease prevalence, mathematical modelling, and economic analyses to identify and evaluate the feasibility of setting an infection target level at which the chronic pathology attributable to lymphatic filariasis - lymphoedema of the extremities and hydroceles - becomes negligible in the face of continuing transmission as a first stage option in achieving the elimination of this parasitic disease. The results show that microfilaria prevalences below a threshold of 3.55% at a blood sampling volume of 1 ml could constitute readily achievable and sustainable targets to control lymphatic filarial disease. They also show that as a result of the high marginal cost of curing the last few individuals to achieve elimination, maximal benefits can occur at this threshold.

Despite the occurrence of a number of studies investigating mosquito survival after infection with filarial worms, there remains conflicting evidence from both laboratory and field experiments as to the existence and mechanism for parasite-induced mortality among filarial mosquitoes. Here, we used a mixed effects meta-analytical framework to combine the data from all available vector-human host blood feeding experiments to evaluate the evidence for the impact of parasite load on the mortality rates of the three major lymphatic filariasis transmitting mosquito genera, Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquitoes, over the extrinsic incubation period of parasitic infection. The results show that, despite the application of this approach, or in the case of Anopheles using a convention fixed effects logistic regression analysis supplemented with additional survival analysis of longitudinal data, no strong association between mortality rate and microfilariae (mf) uptake for either of the three mosquito genera is apparent in the combined data. Instead, a key finding is that study effects played a more crucial role in determining the levels of mortality observed in these experimental studies. This was most revealing in the case of Culex, given that the largest single study in terms of both the number of data points and range of mf intensities, in contrast to smaller studies, showed a significant positive association between mf intensity and mortality, indicating that in this genus at least, the detrimental effect of infection may be manifested only at the highest mf intakes. Although no density dependence in vector mortality was also observed for Aedes, possibly because of the use of restricted human mf intensity range in previous studies, an intriguing finding was that a significantly higher overall mortality was observed for this genus over mfintake ranges that produced much less corresponding mortality in Culex and Anopheles. The results also indicate that currently very little can be said about the survival rate of Anopheles mosquitoes infected with filarial worms because of the striking paucity of data for this genus. Further studies, using standardized methods and covering an appropriate range of mf uptake intensities and using study frameworks that allow the design and comparison of data from both experimental and field experiments, are clearly indicated if we are to reliably quantify the likely effect of filarial infection on vector survival.", "Year": "2009", "Authors": "Michael, E., Snow, L.C., Bockarie, M.J.", "Journal": "Journal of Medical Entomology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "46(4)", "Pages": "873-880", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/033.046.0420", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open via Publisher", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_844 Michael et al 2009 J MED ENT Meta-analysis density dependent processes in LF.

Some experts, however, consider that longer periods of treatment might be necessary in certain high prevalence and transmission environments based upon past unsuccessful field experience and modelling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To evaluate predictors of success in a LF control program we conducted an ecological study during a pre-existing MDA program. We studied 27 villages in Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, from two areas with different infection rates before MDA. We undertook surveys to collect information on variables potentially having an influence on the outcome of the program, including epidemiological (baseline prevalence of infection, immigration rate), entomological (vector density) and operational (treatment coverage, vector control strategies) variables. The success in a village was defined using variables related to the infection (circulating filarial antigenemia prevalence < 1%) and transmission (antigenemia prevalence < 1 in 1000 children born since start of MDA). 8709 people were involved in the MDA program and average coverage rates were around 70%. The overall prevalence of filariasis fell from an initial 17.91% to 3.76% at round 5 (p < 0.001). Viewed on a village by village basis, 12/27 (44%) villages achieved success. In multivariate analysis, low baseline prevalence was the only factor predicting both success in reducing infection rates (OR 19,26; CI 95% 1,12 to 331,82) and success in preventing new infections (OR 27,44; CI 95% 1,05 to 719,6). Low vector density and the use of an optimal vector control strategy were also associated with success in reducing infection rates, but this did not reach statistical significance.

In order to standardize our PCR method and refine our protocol to assess filarial infection levels in mosquitoes, we compared dissection of the vector, Aedes polynesiensis, with the poolscreening polymerase chain reaction (PS-PCR) assay. METHODS: (1) Mosquitoes were collected in human landing catches in five areas in Moorea island, French Polynesia. (2) A fraction of the captured mosquitoes was dissected for Wuchereria bancrofti larvae. (3) Laboratory-reared mosquitoes (uninfected as well as experimentally infected ones) were repeatedly tested to optimize a PS-PCR protocol (DNA extracts from 1-50 pooled mosquitoes were tested with an internal standardized system and primers specific for the Ssp1 repeat sequence. PCR products were analysed by gel electrophoresis). (4) Another fraction of the captured mosquitoes was assayed by PS-PCR according the optimized protocol. RESULTS: The prevalence of field-mosquito infection with W. bancrofti ranged from 1 to 8 % by dissection (L1-L3) and point estimates of infection prevalence, as assayed by PS-PCR, ranged from 0.4 to 3.7 %. There was a moderately strong correlation between larval infection rates as determined by dissection and PCR. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the PS-PCR assay is specific and highly sensitive for detecting parasite DNA. We obtained similar although not identical results with dissections of mosquitoes. PS-PCR appears to be adequate for testing large numbers of mosquitoes in the context of filariasis elimination programs.

Insecticide-treated bed nets are being widely used in areas in which filariasis and malaria are coendemic. METHODS: We studied five villages in which five annual mass administrations of antifilarial drugs, which were completed in 1998, reduced the transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti, one of the nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis. A total of 21,899 anopheles mosquitoes were collected for 26 months before and 11 to 36 months after bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticide were distributed in 2009. We evaluated the status of filarial infection and the presence of W. bancrofti DNA in anopheline mosquitoes before and after the introduction of insecticide-treated bed nets. We then used a model of population dynamics to estimate the probabilities of transmission cessation. RESULTS: Village-specific rates of bites from anopheline mosquitoes ranged from 6.4 to 61.3 bites per person per day before the bed-net distribution and from 1.1 to 9.4 bites for 11 months after distribution (P<0.001). During the same period, the rate of detection of W. bancrofti in anopheline mosquitoes decreased from 1.8% to 0.4% (P=0.005), and the rate of detection of filarial DNA decreased from 19.4% to 14.9% (P=0.13). The annual transmission potential was 5 to 325 infective larvae inoculated per person per year before the bed-net distribution and 0 after the distribution. Among all five villages with a prevalence of microfilariae of 2 to 38%, the probability of transmission cessation increased from less than 1.0% before the bed-net distribution to a range of 4.9 to 95% in the 11 months after distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Vector control with insecticide-treated bed nets is a valuable tool for W. bancrofti elimination in areas in which anopheline mosquitoes transmit the parasite.

Biting rates of both species tended to increase (but not always significantly) for each species in each region each month from the late dry season to the late wet season, and the north coast region had significantly higher biting rates of Ae. aegypti. Insemination rates of Ae. polynesiensis females (94.5-98.8%) were consistently greater than those of Ae. aegypti (87.5-93.5%) throughout the study, but there was no significant difference in the insemination rates of either species between months and regions. Parity rates were generally highest in north coast samples and lowest in west coast samples for both species and generally increased (albeit not always significantly) by month for each species, with a range of 52.9-88.8% for Ae. polynesiensis and 28.6-53.6% for Ae. aegypti, although the high gravid rate (15.8-45.9%) of Ae. aegypti samples (reflecting its feeding more than once in a gonotrophic cycle) confounded both intraspecific and interspecific comparisons. Filarial infection was rare in Ae. aegypti, although both W. bancrofti and D. immitis were recorded, and infection rates in Ae. polynesiensis increased through the study period in each region for both filarias, with up to 4.6% infected and 1.4% infective for W. bancrofti and up to 6.3% infected and 2.5% infective for D. immitis. For W. bancrofti, infection rates were significantly lower on the west coast and also in the dry season, whereas rates for infective stages were significantly greater in the late wet season. For D. immitis there was no significant difference in infection rates between regions, but rates were significantly greater in the late wet season. Rainfall in all months sustains populations of both vectors and explains the relatively few significant differences between seasons; however, the wet season may provide for increased vector abundance and longevity, and present a potentially increased risk for transmission.

As infection rates decline and MDA programs end, efficient and sensitive methods for detecting infections are needed to monitor for recrudescence. Molecular methods, collectively termed 'molecular xenomonitoring,' can identify parasite DNA or RNA in human blood-feeding mosquitoes. We tested mosquitoes trapped throughout the inhabited islands of American Samoa to identify areas of possible continuing LF transmission after completion of MDA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Mosquitoes were collected using BG Sentinel traps from most of the villages on American Samoa's largest island, Tutuila, and all major villages on the smaller islands of Aunu'u, Ofu, Olosega, and Ta'u. Real-time PCR was used to detect Wuchereria bancrofti DNA in pools of </= 20 mosquitoes, and PoolScreen software was used to infer territory-wide prevalences of W. bancrofti DNA in the mosquitoes. Wuchereria bancrofti DNA was found in mosquitoes from 16 out of the 27 village areas sampled on Tutuila and Aunu'u islands but none of the five villages on the Manu'a islands of Ofu, Olosega, and Ta'u. The overall 95% confidence interval estimate for W. bancrofti DNA prevalence in the LF vector Ae. polynesiensis was 0.20-0.39%, and parasite DNA was also detected in pools of Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Aedes (Finlaya) spp. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest low but widespread prevalence of LF on Tutuila and Aunu'u where 98% of the population resides, but not Ofu, Olosega, and Ta'u islands. Molecular xenomonitoring can help identify areas of possible LF transmission, but its use in the LF elimination program in American Samoa is limited by the need for more efficient mosquito collection methods and a better understanding of the relationship between prevalence of W. bancrofti DNA in mosquitoes and infection and transmission rates in humans.", "Year": "2014", "Authors": "Schmaedick, M.A., Koppel, A.L., Pilotte, N., Torres, M., Williams, S.A., Dobson, S.L., Lammie, P.J., Won, K.Y.", "Journal": "PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "8(8)", "Pages": "e3087", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003087", "Work_Location": "American Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Open Access", "Activity - key words": "MDA", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "American Samoa", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_956 Schmaedick et al 2014 PLOS NTDs.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_956_Schmaedick_et_al_2014_PLOS_NTDs.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_956_Schmaedick_et_al_2014_PLOS_NTDs.pdf"}, {"ID": "959", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "656", "HardcopyLocation2020": "", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Diethylcarbamazine in the control of bancroftian filariasis in the Ok Tedi area of Papua New Guinea: phase 2--annual single-dose treatment", "Description": "The Phase 1 semiannual single-dose 6mg/kg diethylcarbamazine (DEC) treatment program demonstrated a significant reduction for Wuchereria bancrofti in the Ok Tedi area of Western Province, Papua New Guinea.

Recent work has indicated that locality-specific bio-ecological complexities affecting parasite transmission may complicate the prediction of LF extinction endpoints, casting uncertainty on the achievement of this initiative. One source of difficulty is the limited quantity and quality of data used to parameterize models of parasite transmission, implying the important need to update initially-derived parameter values. Sequential analysis of longitudinal data following annual MDAs will also be important to gaining new understanding of the persistence dynamics of LF. Here, we apply a Bayesian statistical-dynamical modelling framework that enables assimilation of information in human infection data recorded from communities in Papua New Guinea that underwent annual MDAs, into our previously developed model of parasite transmission, in order to examine these questions in LF ecology and control. RESULTS: Biological parameters underlying transmission obtained by fitting the model to longitudinal data remained stable throughout the study period. This enabled us to reliably reconstruct the observed baseline data in each community. Endpoint estimates also showed little variation. However, the updating procedure showed a shift towards higher and less variable values for worm kill but not for any other drug-related parameters. An intriguing finding is that the stability in key biological parameters could be disrupted by a significant reduction in the vector biting rate prevailing in a locality. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal invariance of biological parameters in the face of intervention perturbations indicates a robust adaptation of LF transmission to local ecological conditions. The results imply that understanding the mechanisms that underlie locally adapted transmission dynamics will be integral to identifying points of system fragility, and thus countermeasures to reliably facilitate LF extinction both locally and globally.", "Year": "2013", "Authors": "Singh, B.K., Bockarie, M.J., Gambhir, M., Siba, P.M., Tisch, D.J., Kazura, J., Michael, E.", "Journal": "PLoS ONE", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "8(6)", "Pages": "e67004", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067004", "Work_Location": "Papua New Guinea", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Open Access", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Papua New Guinea", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_966 Singh et al 2013 PLOS ONE Sequential modeling of effects of Mass drug treatments on anopheline mediated LF infection in PNG.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_966_Singh_et_al_2013_PLOS_ONE_Sequential_modeling_of_effects_of_Mass_drug_treatments_on_anopheline_mediated_LF_infection_in_PNG.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_966_Singh_et_al_2013_PLOS_ONE_Sequential_modeling_of_effects_of_Mass_drug_treatments_on_anopheline_mediated_LF_infection_in_PNG.pdf"}, {"ID": "967", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "664", "HardcopyLocation2020": "", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Population genetics of the filarial worm Wuchereria bancrofti in a post-treatment region of Papua New Guinea: insights into diversity and life history", "Description": "BACKGROUND: Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb) is the primary causative agent of lymphatic filariasis (LF). Our studies of LF in Papua New Guinea (PNG) have shown that it is possible to reduce the prevalence of Wb in humans and mosquitoes through mass drug administration (MDA; diethylcarbamazine with/without ivermectin). While MDAs in the Dreikikir region through 1998 significantly reduced prevalence of Wb infection, parasites continue to be transmitted in the area. METHODS: We sequenced the Wb mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (CO1) gene from 16 people infected with Wb. Patients were selected from 7 villages encompassing both high and moderate annual transmission potentials (ATP). We collected genetic data with the objectives to (i) document contemporary levels of genetic diversity and (ii) distinguish between populations of parasites and hosts across the study area. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We discovered 109 unique haplotypes currently segregating in the Wb parasite population, with one common haplotype present in 15 out of 16 infections. We found that parasite diversity was similar among people residing within the same village and clustered within transmission zones. For example, in the high transmission area, diversity tended to be more similar between neighboring villages, while in the moderate transmission area, diversity tended to be less similar. CONCLUSIONS: In the Dreikikir region of PNG there are currently high levels of genetic diversity in populations of Wb.

Current tools available to monitor LF are limited to diagnostic tests targeting DNA repeats, filarial antigens, and anti-filarial antibodies. While these tools are useful for detection and surveillance, elimination programs have yet to take full advantage of molecular typing for inferring infection history, strain fingerprinting, and evolution. To date, molecular typing approaches have included whole mitochondrial genomes, genotyping, targeted sequencing, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs). These studies have revealed much about Wb biology. For example, in one study in Papua New Guinea researchers identified 5 major strains that were widespread and many minor strains some of which exhibit geographic stratification. Genome data, while rare, has been utilized to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among taxa of the Onchocercidae (the clade of filarial nematodes) and identify gene synteny. Their phylogeny reveals that speciation from the common ancestor of both B. malayi and Wb occurred around 5-6 millions years ago with shared ancestry to other filarial nematodes as recent as 15 million years ago. These discoveries hold promise for gene discovery and identifying drug targets in species that are more amenable to in vivo experiments. Continued technological developments in whole genome sequencing and data analysis will likely replace many other forms of molecular typing, multiplying the amount of data available on population structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetics. Once widely available, the addition of population genetic data from genomic studies should hasten the elimination of LF parasites like Wb. Infectious disease control programs have benefited greatly from population genetics data and recently from population genomics data. However, while there is currently a surplus of data for diseases like malaria and HIV, there is a scarcity of this data for filarial nematodes. With the falling cost of genome sequencing, research on filarial nematodes could benefit from the addition of population genetics statistics and phylogenetics especially in dealing with elimination programs. A comprehensive review focusing on population genetics of filarial nematode does not yet exist. Here our goal is to provide a current overview of the molecular epidemiology of W. bancrofti (Wb) the primary causative agent of LF. We begin by reviewing studies utilizing molecular typing techniques with specific focus on genomic and population datasets. Next, we used whole mitochondrial genome data to construct a phylogeny and examine the evolutionary history of the Onchocercidae. Then, we provide a perspective to aid in understanding how population genetic techniques translate to modern epidemiology.

Mathematical models describing observed mf-L3 functional responses for each of the major three parasite-transmitting vector genera, Aedes, Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes, were fitted to paired mf-L3 data collated from all available studies in the published literature. Model parameters were estimated and compared by deriving and applying a data synthetic framework, based on applying a non-linear weighted regression model for fitting mathematical models to multistudy data. The results confirm previous findings of the existence of significant between-genera differences in the mf-L3 development relationship, particularly with regard to the occurrence of limitation in Culex mosquitoes and facilitation in Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes. New and unexpected findings regarding L3 development from ingested mf were discovered as follows: (1) for Culex, overcompensation in L3 development at higher intensities of mf (or a peaked mf-L3 functional response) was detected; (2) for Aedes mosquitoes, facilitation (with an apparent asymptotic constraint on L3 development at high mf densities) was shown to be the major process governing L3 development, and (3) for Anopheles, a stronger facilitation type of response with no apparent saturation in L3 development appears to govern L3 output from ingested mf.

Here, we use data on mosquito feeding experiments collated from the published literature to examine the available evidence regarding the functional form of the first component of this parasite-vector relationship for Wuchereria bancrofti (Filarioidea: Onchocercidae) causing Bancroftian filariasis, i.e. the rate of microfilariae (mf) uptake from the blood of infected humans by the feeding mosquito vector. Using a simple logarithmic regression model for describing the observed relationships between the mean numbers of mf ingested per mosquito and parasite load in humans in each study, and a linear mixed-effects meta-analytical framework for synthesizing the observed regressions across studies, we show here for the first time clear evidence for the existence of density-dependence in this process for all the three major filariasis transmitting mosquito vectors. An important finding of this study is that this regulation of mf uptake also varies significantly between the vector genera, being weakest in Culex, comparatively stronger in Aedes and most severe and occurring at significantly lower human mf loads in Anopheles mosquitoes. The analysis of the corresponding mf uptake prevalence data has further highlighted how density-dependence in mf uptake may influence the observed distributions of mf in vector populations. These results show that whereas strong regulation of mf uptake, especially when it leads to saturation in uptake at low human parasite intensities, can lead to static distributions of mf per mosquito with host parasite intensity, a weaker regulation of mf ingestion can give rise to changes in both mean mf loads and in the frequency distribution of parasites/mosquito with increasing human parasite intensity. These findings highlight the importance of considering local vector infection dynamics when attempting to predict the impacts of community-based filariasis control.

To examine its usefulness in a single filarial-endemic island assessed at two time points with markedly different levels of transmission, Ab to Wb123 was measured in sera collected from subjects from Mauke, Cook Islands in 1975 (no previous treatment) and 1992 (5 years after a one time island-wide treatment with diethylcarbamazine [DEC]). FINDINGS: Between 1975 and 1992, Wb transmission decreased dramatically as evidenced by reduced prevalences of microfilariae (31% vs. 5%) and circulating Ag (CAg, 49% vs. 16%). Age specific prevalence analysis showed a dramatic reduction in Wb123 Ab positivity from 54% (25/46) in 1975 to 8% (3/38) in 1992 in children 1-5 years (p<0.0001), reflecting the effects of single-dose treatment five years earlier.

In CAg+ subjects the levels of Wb123 Ab were indistinguishable between the 2 time points but differed in those who were CAg- (p<0.0001). In paired sample analysis, individuals who were CAg+ in 1975 but became CAg- in 1992 had significantly lower Ab levels in 1992 (p<0.0001), with 9/40 (23%) becoming seronegative for Wb123.

While several mechanisms have been implicated in mediating this T cell specific downregulation, a role for alterations in the homeostasis of T effector and memory cell populations has not been explored. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we investigated the role of persistent filarial infection on the maintenance of T cell memory in patients from the filarial-endemic Cook Islands. Compared to filarial-uninfected endemic normals (EN), microfilaria (mf) positive infected patients (Inf) had a reduced CD4 central memory (T(CM)) compartment. In addition, Inf patients tended to have more effector memory cells (T(EM)) and fewer effector cells (T(EFF)) than did ENs giving significantly smaller T(EFF):T(EM) ratios. These contracted T(CM) and T(EFF) populations were still evident in patients previously mf+ who had cleared their infection (CLInf). Moreover, the density of IL-7Ralpha, necessary for T memory cell maintenance (but decreased in T effector cells), was significantly higher on memory cells of Inf and CLInf patients, although there was no evidence for decreased IL-7 or increased soluble IL7-Ralpha, both possible mechanisms for signaling defects in memory cells. However, effector cells that were present in Inf and CLInf patients had lower percentages of HLA-DR suggesting impaired function. These changes in T cell populations appear to reflect chronicity of infection, as filarial-infected children, despite the presence of active infection, did not show alterations in the frequencies of these T cell phenotypes. These data indicate that filarial-infected patients have contracted T(CM) compartments and a defect in effector cell development, defects that persist even following clearance of infection.

The safety and efficacy of a single-dose triple-drug therapy of widely used antifilarial drugs diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin (IVM), and albendazole (ALB) for LF is unknown. METHODS: We performed a pilot study to test the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of single-dose DEC, IVM, and ALB in Wuchereria bancrofti-infected Papua New Guineans. Adults were randomized into one of two treatment arms: DEC 6mg/kg+ALB 400mg (N=12) or DEC 6mg/kg+ALB 400mg+IVM 200ug/kg (N=12), and monitored for mf, parasite antigenemia, adverse events (AEs), and serum drug levels. RESULTS: Triple drug therapy induced >2-log reductions in mf levels at 36 and 168 hours after treatment compared with approximately 1-log reduction in mf levels with 2-drugs. All 12 individuals who received 3-drugs were mf-negative one year after treatment, whereas 11 of 12 individuals in the 2-drug regimen were mf-positive. In 6 subjects followed 2 years after treatment, all individuals who had received 3-drugs remained mf negative. Adverse events, particularly fever, myalgias, pruritis and proteinuria/hematuria, occurred in 83% of subjects and were more frequent in the triple drug therapy (p=0.021), and all resolved within 7 days after treatment.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Residents of rural villages near Madang were studied prior to and one year after each of three rounds of MDA with diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole administered per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The mean MDA compliance rate was 72.9%. Three rounds of MDA decreased microfilaremia rates (Mf, 1 ml night blood by filter) from 18.6% pre-MDA to 1.3% after the third MDA (a 94% decrease). Mf clearance rates in infected persons were 71%, 90.7%, and 98.1% after 1, 2, and 3 rounds of MDA. Rates of filarial antigenemia assessed by card test (a marker for adult worm infection) decreased from 47.5% to 17.1% (a 64% decrease) after 3 rounds of MDA. The filarial antibody rate (IgG(4) antibodies to Bm14, an indicator of filarial infection status and/or exposure to mosquito-borne infective larvae) decreased from 59.3% to 25.1% (a 54.6% decrease). Mf, antigen, and antibody rates decreased more rapidly in children <11 years of age (by 100%, 84.2%, and 76.8%, respectively) relative to older individuals, perhaps reflecting their lighter infections and shorter durations of exposure/infection prior to MDA. Incidence rates for microfilaremia, filarial antigenemia, and antifilarial antibodies also decreased significantly after MDA. Filarial DNA rates in Anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes that had recently taken a blood meal decreased from 15.1% to 1.0% (a 92.3% decrease). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MDA had dramatic effects on all filariasis parameters in the study area and also reduced incidence rates. Follow-up studies will be needed to determine whether residual infection rates in residents of these villages are sufficient to support sustained transmission by the An. punctulatus vector.

Finally, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based version of the SspI PCR assay was used to screen blood from 12 patients following treatment with diethylcarbamazine, ivermectin, or both.

However, on Misima Island in Milne Bay Province, government and private sectors have collaborated to implement a pilot elimination programme. Although interim evaluation indicated that the programme has been parasitologically successful, an appreciation that sustainable health gains depend on understanding and accommodating local beliefs prompted this qualitative study. METHODS: We investigated Misima community members knowledge and attitudes about lymphatic filariasis and the elimination programme. A combination of focus groups and key informant interviews were used to explore participants perceptions of health; knowledge of the aetiology and symptoms of filariasis, elephantiasis and hydrocele; attitudes towards the disease and mass drug distribution; and the social structure and decision-making protocols within the villages. RESULTS: Focus group discussions proved inferior to key informant interviews for gathering rich data. Study participants did not consider lymphatic filariasis (\"pom\") a major health problem but were generally positive about mass drug administration campaigns. A variety of conditions were frequently and incorrectly attributed to filariasis. Participants expressed the belief that individuals infected with filariasis always had visible manifestations of disease. A common misconception was that taking drugs during campaigns provided long-term immunity against disease. The role of mosquito vectors in transmission was not generally appreciated and certain clinical presentations, particularly hydrocele, were associated with supernatural forces. Multiple adverse events were associated with mass drug administration campaigns and most study participants mentioned community members who did not participate in campaigns.

They met with the Assistant CEO of Health, the coordinator of the LF program and the LF/MDA committee. They conducted individual interviews with young males, village mayors, household members in one low compliance/high prevalence area and one high compliance/low prevalence area. They also conducted interviews with women\u2019s representatives who were involved in tablets distribution during the previous MDA. These activities were conducted with the LF coordinator from the MOH, the WHO SSA in charge of the LF program, two staff from the MOH, one of them trained in COMBI in Fiji in 2007 but who never had an opportunity to practice and use her COMBI skills. Therefore this visit was used as an on-the-spot training on interviews and on how to gather information to develop a communication plan. Youth interviews were carried out using Top-Of-the-Mind-Analysis (TOMA) and Day-In-the-Life-Of (DILO) questionnaires and opened questions with key informants. \nOn Saturday evening the data collected were entered into an Excel database, analysed and discussed by the MOH/WHO team. A powerpoint presentation highlighting the main findings and recommendations was prepared and presented to the ACEO on Sunday afternoon. A discussion followed the presentation on communication strategies needed in order to improve MDA coverage and reach the target of at least 85% of the general population ingesting the drugs. This plan (slides 25 to 33 of the power point presentation) will need to be further fed and developed by the MOH team based on additional interviews to be conducted in urban areas in particular. \nCONCLUSIONS \nDespite a low MDA coverage (below 70%) for three out of six rounds the MDA carried out since 1999 have effectively reduced antigenemia and microfilaremia prevalence to low levels. However, the target of below 1% antigenemia prevalence has not been reached and the increase of the ICT and Mf prevalence between 2004 and 2007 is a concern even if the methods used for the sampling method are not exactly the same. The fact that during the 2007 survey LF antigen and Mf has been detected in children indicating that transmission has occurred in the past five years is also of concern. Additional rounds of \u201cimproved Mass Drug Administration\u201d will be needed starting 2008. In order to achieve a coverage of at least 85% of the total population ingesting the drugs during the next rounds of MDA a number of activities focusing on new distribution and communication strategies will be needed as per the plan discussed with the MOH on the last day of this mission. It will be of tremendous importance to get a strong social mobilisation based on the communication plans and activities developed during this mission. Specific messages will need to be developed to reach each of the target audience identified: young males, elderly, female and usually compliant people, etc \nRECOMMENDATIONS \n1) A minimum of two additional rounds of \u201cimproved MDA\u201d should be implemented starting in 2008 with a targeted coverage of at least 85% of the general population AND at least 85% of the male group. The distribution strategy should be a directly observed treatment. A special attention should be paid to the previously \u201ctoo old\u201d and \u201ctoo sick\u201d categories and a specific strategy developed for this particular group. \n2) The strong leadership and new directions taken by the Ministry of Health demonstrate a high commitment and all efforts should be made to support the new strategy and the focused distribution in three days. The important shift from a long timeframe to a short time frame distribution, from a passive attitude to an active behaviour from the communities, from a non DOT to a DOT strategy will need a well organiosed and comprehensive communication plan. \n3) The breakdown of the budget needed for this MDA should be urgently finalised to approach donors and partners. \n4) The communication strategy discussed during this mission and presented to the MOH on the last day of this visit (attached powerpoint presentation) should be further developed and implemented. It will be of tremendous importance to mobilise and get strong support from all sectors, leaders and media if the target is going to be met.", "Year": "2008", "Authors": "Capuano, C.", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "48", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "MDA", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Samoa", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1138 WHO WPRO 2008 Mission Report Capuano Lymphatic filariasis Samoa 3-7 April 2008", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "PacELF_1138_WHO_WPRO_2008_Mission_Report_Capuano_Lymphatic_filariasis_Samoa_3-7_April_2008", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_1138_WHO_WPRO_2008_Mission_Report_Capuano_Lymphatic_filariasis_Samoa_3-7_April_2008"}, {"ID": "1139", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "86", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Reports and Results", "Title": "Mission Report  Consultancy for PacELF Suva Fiji 11-31 oct 2004", "Description": "Consultancy report and paper outlines;

Encouraged by this rapid expansion, the partners of the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) set the target for MDA coverage at 350 million people in 2005. Subsequently, a strategic plan for scaling up to achieve the target was developed in 2003 in consultation with partners, including the endemic countries. This strategic plan covering the period 2003\u20132005 was approved by TAG-LF. To ensure that this target is realistic, however, and to assess the resource requirements, each endemic country with an active programme was requested to provide a forecast of scaling up of MDA for the period 2004\u20132008. The forecast was to include funding requirements, with an indication of resources that would be provided by the ministry of health.

There are more than a billion people who are at risk of lymphatic filariasis, which is not a killer disease. The infection is caused by thread- like worms (filariae) which lodge in the lymphatic system, producing millions of minute larvae (microfilariae) that circulate in the blood. Although infection often occurs in childhood, the symptoms are commonly delayed until adulthood. Over 120 million people are currently living with the disease, including about 40 million who are incapacitated and disfigured by it. Of all diseases, lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability. Until recently, the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis depended on night blood examinations to detect microfilariae. Now, there is an antigen-detection test that can be taken at any time of the day, making it feasible to map the disease geographically. Drugs, which are available free or at low cost, kill the microfilariae in the blood. Simple methods of hygiene and self-care can reduce the effects of the disease. With such effective tools to hand, the Fiftieth World Health Assembly, in 1997, resolved to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem.

In 1997 the World Health Assembly endorsed efforts to eliminate transmission of filariasis on a country by country basis (WHA resolution 50.29). Filariasis is a disease which is endemic in communities worldwide affecting an estimated 120 million persons. Table 1 lists those countries where human filariasis has been: (i) endemic during the 1980s and 1990s, (ii) endemic or possibly endemic before 1980 but not recognized since then, (iii) sporadically reported without evidence of endemic disease. In 1998, there is still lack of knowledge about when transmission of filariasis was interrupted in many countries. The need for certification of attainment is inherent in the goal of an elimination programme; such a need does not exist for control programmes. There must be an objective basis, according to agreed criteria, for determining whether transmission of filariasis has indeed been eliminated; the criteria must take into account the risk of importation from filariasis endemic countries. It is expected that efforts towards elimination of filariasis transmission for individual countries will be conducted until the global certification of elimination of filariasis is achieved. In order to complete the process of certifying elimination, an independent International Commission for the Certification of Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination (ICCLFE) will be established by World Health Organization (WHO). This commission will recommend to the Organization those countries that fulfil the requirements for certification, as well as advise the Organization on criteria, procedures and progress made towards elimination of filariasis transmission. The commission will also designate a panel of specialists, whose members can be assigned to International Certification Teams (ICTs). WHO, including the Regional offices, will facilitate national preparations for certification by carrying out regular visits by WHO staff, members of the designated ICT, or consultants to the country or sub-region concerned. A register will be established of countries requesting certification and also of those countries where official certification of elimination is pending. Finally WHO will also establish an official register of countries where filariasis has been eliminated, ba5ed on evaluations by the ICCLFE. The aim of the present document is to describe the criteria for verifying the absence of filariasis transmission. In addition WHO has developed a document addressing issues of disease ascertainment, monitoring, and pre-elimination surveillance - i.e., addressing the various issues before elimination certification (see document WHO/FIL/99.195).", "Year": "1998", "Authors": "World Health Organization", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "World Health Organization", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "20", "View_at_Publisher": "http://www.who.int/lymphatic_filariasis/resources/who_fil_99.197/en/", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "MDA, TAS, blood survey,", "Other keywords": "Criteria for certification, Certification procedures, Pre-Certification Activities,", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1213 WHO 1998 Guidelines for Certifying Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1213_WHO_1998_Guidelines_for_Certifying_Lymphatic_Filariasis_Elimination.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_1213_WHO_1998_Guidelines_for_Certifying_Lymphatic_Filariasis_Elimination.pdf"}, {"ID": "1214", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "357", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Guidelines and Instructional Materials", "Title": "Space Spray Application of Insecticides for Vector and Public Health Pest Control", "Description": "A practitioner's guide", "Year": "2003", "Authors": "World Health Organization", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "WHO Communicable Disease Control, Prevention and Eradication; WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES)", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "43", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "Not a scientific paper - not checked", "Activity - key words": "vector control", "Other keywords": "Space spray treatments, Space spray equipment, insecticide products, operational guidelines", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Space_Spray_Application_of_Insecticides_for_Vector_and_Public_Health_Pest_Control.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Space_Spray_Application_of_Insecticides_for_Vector_and_Public_Health_Pest_Control.txt"}, {"ID": "1215", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "132", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Guidelines and Instructional Materials", "Title": "Lymphatic filariasis: A handbook of practical entomology = Filariose lympatique: entomologie practique", "Description": "Overview: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis has scaled up its activities more rapidly than almost any other global public health programme. By the end of 2011, 53 of 73 endemic countries were implementing mass drug administration, and more than 3.9 billion treatments had been delivered to 952 million people. Challenges remain, however, in meeting the goal of eliminating the disease. Vector control is a possible complementary strategy in countries or areas (i) where mass drug administration has not started, such as those where loiasis is co-endemic; (ii) where the burden of lymphatic filariasis is heaviest and mass drug administration must be rapidly scaled up or (iii) where the expected impact of mass drug administration has not been achieved; and where local transmission has been interrupted to prevent recurrence. This document explains why vector control is important in national programmes and describes the preparation of a tailor-made control plan for national programmes. It outlines entomological procedures for regular and specific vector control and how data should be analysed for better overall understanding of filarial transmission and vectors. The document will also be useful for teaching personnel in lymphatic filariasis programmes about the use and value of entomological procedures in overall epidemiological appraisal in the context of elimination.

Eleven persons remained microfilaremic, whereas 18 had cleared both microfilaremia and antigenemia. Despite decreased infection on the island, antibody levels remained relatively constant for the subjects with persistent microfilaremia (Mf+/+), in contrast to sharp decreases for both EN subjects and subjects with cleared microfilaremia (Mf+/-). Although clinically indistinguishable from the EN subjects, the Mf+/- group had antibody levels (IgG, IgG4, and IgE) significantly lower than those of the EN subjects. Lymphocyte responses to parasite antigens were marginally greater in Mf+/- than in Mf+/+ subjects, but both groups remained less cell responsive (as measured by proliferation, interleukin-5, interleukin-10, interferon-\u03b3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) than did the EN subjects. These findings suggest that, for microfilaremic persons, complete clearance of infection is not sufficient to restore \"normal\" immune responsiveness; filarial infection may induce very long-term deficits in the ability to respond to parasite antigens", "Year": "2001", "Authors": "Steel, C., Ottesen, E.A.", "Journal": "Journal of Infectious Diseases", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "184(1)", "Pages": "73-79", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/321004", "Work_Location": "Cook Islands", "Access_Rights": "Open via Publisher", "Open status checking ": "Open Access", "Activity - key words": "MDA", "Other keywords": "ELISA, antigen, DEC", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Cook Islands", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1222 Steel and Ottesen 2001 JID Evolution of longitudinal responses in LF 30137142.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "download_url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/321004"}, {"ID": "1225", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "94", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Lymphatic filariasis elimination: Progress in global programme development", "Description": "The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) is an innovative, public-private partnership for health improvement. The progress made since the programme was initiated, in 1998, is here reviewed. The programme is largely based on the regular mass administration of albendazole with either ivermectin (Mectizan\u00ae) or diethylcarbamazine. Both albendazole and ivermectin have been donated by their manufacturers, for as long as necessary. The first national campaigns based on these drugs commenced in late 1999. Since then, rapid progress has been made in confirming the safety of the drug combinations, establishing a regional approach, and recognizing that experiences, epidemiological settings, health systems, the best drug combinations and disease burdens all vary with the country involved. There is a continuing trend towards decentralization, and this should lead to greater regional and national ownership and more inter-country activities. The progress made in mapping the geographical distribution of lymphatic filariasis (LF), by designated implementation units and, ultimately, by country, is also summarized. Country-specific methods of social mobilization and drug distribution, that are compatible with health planning at central and district level, need to be developed. However, the assessment of coverage by mass drug administration (MDA) needs to be strengthened, to allow reliable national monitoring and inter-country or inter-region comparisons. Valuable contributions made by non-governmental development organizations (NGDO) and civil society organizations (CSO) are acknowledged, such organizations (and particularly local NGDO) should be encouraged to help more in implementing the various activities at district level. The GPELF has developed during an era of considerable change in international health policy. The programme can contribute to the relief of poverty, as LF is closely associated with low-income communities in the least developed countries and MDA is a pro-poor intervention. There are clear opportunities for linking the activities of the GPELF (which uses cheap or free drugs that bring considerable incidental health benefits, in addition to arresting the transmission of the parasites causing LF) with other health interventions. New evidence indicates that annual treatments with antifilarial drugs greatly reduce the clinical abnormalities of the disease. The programme has expanded rapidly, with the annual number of people treated rising from 2.9 million (in 12 countries) in the year 2000 to 25.89 million (in 22 countries) in 2001 and an estimated 80 million (in 34 countries) in 2002. At the recent meeting of the Global Alliance, held in New Delhi in May 2002, a significant but realistic challenge - of scaling-up the programme to cover up to 350 million of those at risk, by the end of 2005 - was set. The rate of growth necessary to meet this target presents considerable strategic and managerial challenges to all of the partners involved in the programme, from the development of synergies with other, large-scale, public-health interventions to the logistics of drug manufacture, shipping and local transportation and resolving the problems of social mobilization, reporting, evaluation and monitoring on such a scale. Such challenges are, however, easily outweighed by the potential benefits of success. If the international health community cannot provide the necessary support to complement the investments being made by the endemic countries (as they scale-up their LF-elimination campaigns and ensure yearly access to two free and efficacious drugs that bring major benefits to those treated), significant progress in the control of other infectious diseases becomes a very distant goal.", "Year": "2002", "Authors": "Molyneux, D.H., Zagaria, N.", "Journal": "Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "96 (SUPPL. 2)", "Pages": "S15-S40", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "NGDO, DEC, albendazole", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1225 Molyneux and Zagaria 2002 ATMP Lymphatic filariasis elimination progress in global programme development.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1225_Molyneux_and_Zagaria_2002_ATMP_Lymphatic_filariasis_elimination_progress_in_global_programme_development.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_1225_Molyneux_and_Zagaria_2002_ATMP_Lymphatic_filariasis_elimination_progress_in_global_programme_development.pdf"}, {"ID": "1226", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "95", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Impact of Mass Drug Administration On Aedes-transmitted filariasis In the Pacific", "Description": "Working paper for the Scientific Working Group meeting on Lymphatic Filariasis Research, TDR, Geneva 10-12 May 2005", "Year": "2005", "Authors": "Burkot, T.R., Melrose, W.D., Durrheim, D.N., Speare, R., Ichimori, K.", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "10", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Pacific", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "MDA", "Other keywords": "DEC, albendazole, mf rate, densities, vector, larvae,", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Impact_of_Mass_Drug_Administration_On_Aedes-transmitted_filariasis_In_the_Pacific.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Impact_of_Mass_Drug_Administration_On_Aedes-transmitted_filariasis_In_the_Pacific.txt"}, {"ID": "1228", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "97", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Action/Strategic Plans", "Title": "Plan of Action for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis in the Western Pacific Region", "Description": "Plan by country with budgets", "Year": "2009", "Authors": "", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "8", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Pacific", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "WPRO region", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Plan_of_Action_for_the_Elimination_of_Lymphatic_Filariasis_in_the_Western_Pacific_Region.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Plan_of_Action_for_the_Elimination_of_Lymphatic_Filariasis_in_the_Western_Pacific_Region.txt"}, {"ID": "1229", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "99", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "The argument for integrating vector control with multiple drug administration campaigns to ensure elimination of lymphatic filariasis", "Description": "Background: There is a danger that mass drug administration campaigns may fail to maintain adequate treatment coverage to achieve lymphatic filariasis elimination. Hence, additional measures to suppress transmission might be needed to ensure the success of the Global Program for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis. Discussion: Vector control successfully eliminated lymphatic filariasis when implemented alone or with mass drug administration. Challenges to lymphatic filariasis elimination include uncertainty of the exact level and duration of microfilarial suppression required for elimination, the mobility of infected individuals, consistent non-participation of some infected individuals with mass drug administration, the possible development of anti-filarial drug resistance and treatment strategies in areas co-endemic with loasis. Integration of vector control with mass drug administration can address some of these challenges. The potential benefits of vector control would include: (1) the ability to suppress filariasis transmission without the need to identify all individual 'foci of infection'; (2) minimizing the risk of reestablishment of transmission from imported microfilaria positive individuals; and (3) decreasing the risk of dengue or malaria transmission where, respectively, Aedes or Anopheles are lymphatic filariasis vectors. Summary: With adequate sustained treatment coverage, mass drug administration should meet the criteria for elimination of lymphatic filariasis. However, it may be difficult to sustain sufficiently high mass drug administration coverage to achieve lymphatic filariasis elimination in some areas, particularly, where Aedes species are the vectors. Since vector control was effective in controlling and even eliminating lymphatic filariasis transmission, integration of vector control with mass drug administration will ensure the sustainability of transmission suppression and thereby, better ensure the success of national filariasis elimination programs. Although trials of some vector control interventions are needed, proven vector control strategies are ready for immediate integration with mass drug administration for many important vectors. Vector control is the only presently available additional lymphatic filariasis control measure with the potential for immediate implementation.", "Year": "2006", "Authors": "Burkot, T.R., Durrheim, D.N., Melrose, W.D., Speare, R., Ichimori, K.", "Journal": "Filaria Journal", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "5(10)", "Pages": "7", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2883-5-10", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Pacific", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Not matched on Scopus (e.g. Worldwide) but confirmed Open", "Activity - key words": "MDA", "Other keywords": "vector control, DEC, albendazole, mf rate, GPELF", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Pacific", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1229 Burkot et al 2006 FILARIA J The argument for integrating vector control 1475-2883-5-10.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1229_Burkot_et_al_2006_FILARIA_J_The_argument_for_integrating_vector_control_1475-2883-5-10.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_1229_Burkot_et_al_2006_FILARIA_J_The_argument_for_integrating_vector_control_1475-2883-5-10.pdf"}, {"ID": "1230", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "103", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Parasitology Today Tick-Host Immunology", "Description": "The ICT filariasis test.

Diversity in immune response presumably may lead to myriad clinical presentations, such as overt chronic filariasis, occult filariasis with atypical systemic manifestation and asymptomatic microfilariae carrier state. Anticipated oxidative stress during inflammatory response to infective conditions might complicate the immune response and thus might alter the disease outcome. The present study was carried out to assess the status of oxidative stress in different clinical presentations of bancroftian filariasis. Twenty-five microfilariae carriers and 30 cases each of chronic filariasis and occult filariasis were compared to 30 endemic normal individuals. Serum malondialdehyde level and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity were measured by spectrophotometric methods and levels of filarial antigen were measured by ELISA. In the filarial cases, the levels of these parameters were assayed again after treatment with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC). Results showed significant (P < 0.05) association of oxidative stress with chronic and occult filariasis but not with microfilarial carriers. DEC therapy in both clinical cases and carriers resulted in a significant reduction of oxidative stress associated with decreased antigen level (P < 0.01). These findings suggest the possible involvement of oxidative stress in filarial disease pathology.

A total of 232 microfilaraemics were identified by filtration of 1 ml of blood. The microfilaria (mf) prevalence ranged from 6% to 54%, and the mf density in microfilaraemics ranged from 1 mf/ml to 6028 mf/ml. PCR assays both for W. bancrofti or Brugia spp. detected a single mf present on a 30 \u03bcl dried filter paper blood spot. One hundred and seventy-eight pools of five blood spots in each pool (pool-5) were tested by PCR and 101 (57%) pools were positive. When pool size was increased to 10 spots per pool (pool-10), 65 (70%) of 93 pools were positive. Pearson's correlation and linear regression showed a strong correlation between filtration and pool screen PCR results for pool-10 (r = 0.835) and pool-5 (r = 0.695). Based on the determination coefficient (R), the results of pool-10 PCR (R = 0.697) gave a better prediction compared with pool-5 PCR (R = 0.483).

The public health importance of lymphatic filariasis has generated a large body of research in this area, both in laboratory studies (Ottesen, 1984,1989; Maizels & Lawrence, 1991) and in the field (Hayashi, 1962; Hairston & Jachowski, 1968; Denham & McGreevy, 1977; Vanamail et al. 1989 b; Bundy, Grenfell & Rajagopalan, 1991; Srividya et al. 1991 b). Despite this, there is still no conclusive explanation for the apparently complex relationship between infection and clinical disease observed in human communities. At least part of the problem may lie in the current impossibility of measuring adult worm burden in vivo (Pichon et al. 1980; Denham & Fletcher, 1987; Das et al. 1990; Grenfell et al.1990). Although there has recently been significant progress in the development of immuno logical markers for infection status in humans (Ottesen, 1989; Day et al. 1991 a), microfilaraemia is still the most reliable measure of current infection in the field. Studies in endemic areas indicate that, far from there being any simple direct relationship between microfilaraemia and disease status, it is possible to find some individuals with microfilariae in their blood but no disease, and indeed with all other combinations of infection and disease status (Hairston & de-Meillon, 1968; Hairston & Jachowski, 1968; Beaver, 1970; Bryan & Southgate, 1976; Denham & McGreevy, 1977; Pani et al. 1991).

In principle, assays based on recombinant filarial antigens should address these limitations and provide useful tools for diagnosis and surveillance of LF. The present multicenter study was designed to compare the performance of antibody assays for filariasis based on recombinant antigens Bm14, WbSXP, and BmR1. Coded serum specimens were distributed to five participating laboratories where assays for each antigen were conducted in parallel. Assays based on Bm14, WbSXP, or BmR1 demonstrated good sensitivity (>90%) for field use and none of the assays demonstrated reactivity with specimens from persons with nonfilarial helminth infections.

Previous control efforts including sporadic mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns have reduced the prevalence to low levels but have not succeeded in eliminating the disease. To effectively plan, model and evaluate the worldwide elimination effort, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPFLF) needs data on filariasis epidemiology (including age and sex-specific prevalence and the density of microfilariae (Mf)) and estimates of the number of years of MDA required for elimination. The five-year nationwide MDA campaign carried out in Samoa before the start of the Pacific Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PacELF) generated extensive data on these issues. Methodology\u2044Principal Findings: MDA campaigns were conducted in Samoa with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in 1993 to 1995 and DEC plus ivermectin in 1996 to 1997 for all persons aged 2 years and above. Coverage of the MDA, as assessed from the campaign village register books, ranged from 62% to 97% depending on the year, and was over 80% in three out of five years. Village based surveys showed that prevalence of Mf declined from 4.3% in 1993 (N=10,256) to 1.1% in 1998 (N=4,054) (P\u03c72=94.4, p<0.001). Males had a three- to five-fold higher prevalence than females, and this difference remained consistent over the five-year period. Transmission was still occurring over the period as shown by the occurrence of new infections in 3 children less than 5 years old out of 5,691 tested (five-year cumulative incidence of 0.53 per thousand children for the period 1993 to 1998). There was a statistically significant reduction in the geometric mean number of Mf per 60 \u03bcl in positive cases between 1993 (11.8) and 1998 (6.9) (t=2.61; p<0.01). The proportion of people with a high density of Mf - over 60 Mf per 60 \u03bcl (1000 per ml) - declined from to 19.4% to 4.0% (P\u03c72=5.6, p=0.018). Conclusions\u2044Significance: Five years of sustained MDA with DEC (3 years) and DEC plus ivermectin (2 years) reduced the prevalence of Mf of W.bancrofti in Samoa by 74%. Density of Mf in infected individuals was also significantly reduced. Males had a three to five-fold higher prevalence than women. New infections in children less than five years old still occurred at a low level, suggesting that transmission was not completely interrupted.

The meeting was opened by Dr H. Endo, Director, Department of Control, Prevention, and Eradication (CPE) of the Communicable Diseases Cluster. Dr Endo welcomed all the participants and thanked TAG-ELF members for contributing their time and expertise. He pointed out that the meeting was particularly critical because of the financial crisis affecting WHO and the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF). The meeting was attended by all 14 members of TAG-ELF. Other participants were members of the WHO Secretariat, staff of the WHO Regional Offices for Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific, technical experts to advise TAG-ELF on specific issues, and observers from the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF). Dr K.Y. Dadzie continued to serve as Chairman and Dr D. Addiss was appointed Rapporteur. Dr Dadzie welcomed the participants and introduced two new TAG-ELF members- Professor Dato Dr C.P. Ramachandran (Malaysia) and Dr Addiss (USA). A full list of participants is given in Annex 1. Dr Dadzie suggested minor rescheduling of the agenda. Dr Ramachandran moved to accept the revised agenda and this was seconded by Dr R. Henderson. The agenda adopted is given in Annex 2. Dr Henderson pointed out that the fmancial crisis affecting WHO was also felt by the filariasis elimination programmes at country level, and suggested that \"packaging\" lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination with programmes for the control of other parasitic diseases, such as intestinal helminths, might have advantages. Dr Dadzie agreed and indicated that this issue would be addressed on the agenda.", "Year": "2004", "Authors": "World Health Organization", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "World Health Organization", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "38", "View_at_Publisher": "http://www.who.int/lymphatic_filariasis/resources/cds_cpe_cee_2004.42/en/", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "Not a scientific paper - not checked", "Activity - key words": "MDA, blood survey, Mapping,TAS", "Other keywords": "Switzerland, loaloa, single drugs, stop MDA,", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "French version can be found at publishers site", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1293 TAG-ELF Fifth meeting 2004.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "PacELF_1293_TAG-ELF_Fifth_meeting_2004.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_1293_TAG-ELF_Fifth_meeting_2004.txt"}, {"ID": "1296", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "129", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "2735", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Report on Lymphatic filariasis Scientific Working Group", "Description": "", "Year": "2005", "Authors": "Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Pacific", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "MDA, blood survey, vecter control", "Other keywords": "Switzerland, Aedes vectors, long term impact of MDA, cost, ADLA", "Language": "Japanese", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Report_on_Lymphatic_filariasis_Scientific_Working_Group.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Report_on_Lymphatic_filariasis_Scientific_Working_Group.txt"}, {"ID": "1298", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "139", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Meeting Reports", "Title": "American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 60th Annnual Meeting Program", "Description": "December 4-8, 2011, Philadelphia Marriott Downtown", "Year": "2011", "Authors": "", "Journal": "American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene", "Publisher": "American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene", "Volume_Issue": "85(6)", "Pages": "303", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "Not a scientific paper - not checked", "Activity - key words": "MDA, Mapping", "Other keywords": "Molecular Biology, Stoop MDA, Insecticide", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "American_Society_of_Tropical_Medicine_and_Hygiene_60th_Annnual_Meeting_Program.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/American_Society_of_Tropical_Medicine_and_Hygiene_60th_Annnual_Meeting_Program.txt"}, {"ID": "1299", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "142", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "1863; 2770; 3067", "Category": "Meeting Reports", "Title": "Report from Informal Consultation on Albendazole Research", "Description": "Report from Informal Consultation on Albendazole Research.

Over the same period, the global burden of non-communicable diseases has increased absolutely and relative to communicable diseases. In this changing landscape, national programmes for the control of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases must be reinforced and adapted for three reasons: the global burden of these communicable diseases remains enormous, disease control programmes have an integral and supporting role in developing health systems, and the health benefits of these control programmes go beyond the containment of specific infections. WHO's traditional role in promoting communicable disease control programmes must also adapt to new circumstances. Among a multiplicity of actors, WHO's task is to enhance its normative role as convenor, coordinator, monitor, and standard-setter, fostering greater coherence in global health.", "Year": "2013", "Authors": "Dye.

The IVM approach aims to contribute to achieving the global targets set for vector-borne disease control by making vector control more efficacious, cost-effective, ecologically sound and sustainable. This document addresses the use of IVM for two of the most important vector-borne diseases: malaria and lymphatic filariasis. The IVM approach is useful and appropriate for jointly managing control activities against malaria and lymphatic filariasis in terms of planning, implementation and monitoring, particularly in areas where both infections are transmitted by the same species of mosquito vectors. IVM may concurrently reduce the incidence of both diseases so that control efforts have synergistic effects. In this way, IVM enables resources to be used more efficiently to control multiple vector-borne diseases and thus they have a greater impact on public health than would be the case with control programmes aimed at a single disease.", "Year": "2011", "Authors": "World Health Organization", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "World Health Organization", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "4", "View_at_Publisher": "http://www.who.int/lymphatic_filariasis/resources/who_htm_ntd_pct_2011.2/en/", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "MDA", "Other keywords": "NTD, WHO position statement, integrated Vector Management, malaria programe", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1371 WHO 2011 Integrated vector management to control malaria and lymphatic filariasis.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1371_WHO_2011_Integrated_vector_management_to_control_malaria_and_lymphatic_filariasis.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_1371_WHO_2011_Integrated_vector_management_to_control_malaria_and_lymphatic_filariasis.pdf"}, {"ID": "1372", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "353", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "253", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Transmission assessment surveys in the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis: WHO position statement", "Description": "Overview: In 1997, the 50th World Health Assembly resolved to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem.

The disease has been targeted for global elimination by 2020. Transmission control and disability alleviation are the two pillars of the elimination strategy under the Global Programme for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF). Interruption of transmission is being achieved by mass annual administration of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or ivermectin to entire communities at risk of infection. When community drug consumption rates are adequate, this is expected to result in reduction of transmission of lymphatic filariasis to low levels, and ultimately in elimination of filariasis, preventing new infections from occurring and protecting future generations from the disease. Recognizing the physical suffering, gross disfigurement and consequent socioeconomic impact due to lymphoedema (particularly limbs), and the fact that simple foot hygiene can result in prevention of repeated attacks of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL) and progression of lymphoedema, efforts are being taken to teach patients and their families skin care and simple measures of hygiene. It is realized that a disability alleviation strategy needs to be evolved for lymphatic filariasis patients who suffer from several urogenital manifestations, the burden of which is larger than that due to lymphoedema of limbs. In view of this, the WHO unit for Strategy Development and Monitoring for Eradication and Elimination (CEE) called for an informal consultation meeting of surgeons to address the issue of surgical management of urogenital manifestations of filariasis.", "Year": "2002", "Authors": "World Health Organization", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "World Health Organization", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "34", "View_at_Publisher": "http://www.who.int/lymphatic_filariasis/resources/who_cds_cpe_cee_2002.33/en/", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Not a scientific paper -

Throughout this period, the need for standardized guidelines on monitoring and epidemiological assessment of the Programme at implementation unit level has become increasingly evident because this is the level at which the core programmatic operations are conducted. These guidelines are based on current knowledge and understanding of the epidemiological aspects of the disease. However, in view of the rapid involvement of both scientific advances and experience in implementation of national elimination programmes, adaptation of the guidelines might be required to address particular circumstances. In light of the diverse responsibilities of the health personnel in charge of lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes, the authors have developed guidelines that are as concise as possible.

Blood samples were collected simultaneously every 4 hours during a 48 hour period by finger-prick and venipuncture for determination of microfilaremia by both blood film and membrane filtration technique methods, and for determination of antigenemia. The membrane filtration results showed no significant nycthemeral variations between the microfilaria densities at hours 16:00, 20: 00, 24:00, 04:00, 08:00 and 12:00. Conversely, the blood film method showed a significant difference between the microfilaria densities: the microfilaremia was higher during the day (12:00-20:00 hours) than during the night (24:00-08:00 hours). As for antigenemia, using Og 4 C3 monoclonal antibody, there was no significant fluctuation during 48 hours. These results confirm that W bancrofti var. pacifica is subperiodic and diurnal in French Polynesia. In particular, they substantiate the validity of examining venous blood by the membrane filtration technique as the judgment criterion of choice in therapeutic trials and of examining capillary blood during peak hours by the blood film method for evalauting the endemic level in a population.", "Year": "1993", "Authors": "Moulia-Pelat, J.P., Glaziou, P., Chanteau, S., Nguyen-Ngoc, L., Marcet, Y., Gardines, R., Martin, P.M.V., Cartel, J.L.", "Journal": "Tropical Medicine and Parasitology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "44(2)", "Pages": "83-85", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "French Polynesia", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "blood survey", "Other keywords": "antigen,", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Periodicity_of_Wuchereria_bancrofti_var._pacifica_filariasis_in_French_Polynesia.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Periodicity_of_Wuchereria_bancrofti_var._pacifica_filariasis_in_French_Polynesia.txt"}, {"ID": "1592", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1395", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "1429: 1463; 3112", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Strategies and tools for the control/elimination of lymphatic filariasis", "Description": "Lymphatic filariasis infects 120 million people in 73 countries worldwide and continues to be a worsening problem, especially in Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Elephantiasis, lymphoedema, and genital pathology afflict 44 million men, women and children; another 76 million have parasites in their blood and hidden internal damage to their lymphatic and renal systems. In the past, tools and strategies for the control of the condition were inadequate, but over the last 10 years dramatic research advances have led to new understanding about the severity and impact of the disease, new diagnostic and monitoring tools, and, most importantly, new treatment tools and control strategies. The new strategy aims both at transmission control through community-wide (mass) treatment programmes and at disease control through individual patient management. Annual single-dose coadministration of two drugs (ivermectin + diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or albendazole) reduces blood microfilariae by 99% for a full year; even a single dose of one drug (ivermectin or DEC) administered annually can result in 90% reductions; field studies confirm that such reduction of microfilarial loads and prevalence can interrupt transmission. New approaches to disease control, based on preventing bacterial superinfection, can now halt or even reverse the lymphoedema and elephantiasis sequelae of filarial infection.

The overall prevalence rate was 4.5% by the NP method and 3.8% by the FP method. The average microfilarial prevalence in males was 2.3 times higher than in females, and the rate among males aged 30 years and over was as high as 20%. The positive cases were found to be concentrated in certain households. The median microfilarial density (MfD-50) for the whole of Samoa was 18.6 using 60-mm3 blkood samples (males, 21.4; females 14.2). While the MfD-50 of any village has a positive association with the microfilarial prevalence rate of that village, a relatively high MfD-50 was noticed among young people under 20 years of age together with low prevalence rates. The negative binomial distribution was fitted to the data on the distribution of microfilarial counts in Samoa and gave a better fit than the log-normal distribution. The data having been fitted to the negative binomial, the number of false negatives could be determined as 9% of the estimated number of positives in the survey population when the NP method was employed and about 25% with the FP method. Further studies revealed that 15.1% of the microfilaria carriers presented some clinical manifestation, the most common being an attack of filarial fever (13.1%). The average duration of a fever attack was 3.5 days and the total period with fever/person/year averaged 27.1 days.", "Year": "1985", "Authors": "Kimura, E., Penaia, L., Spears, G.F.S.", "Journal": "Bulletin of the World Health Organization", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "63(5)", "Pages": "869-880", "View_at_Publisher": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2536451/", "Work_Location": "Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity -

Development of an easy-touse, rapid-format diagnostic tool has facilitated precise location of infectious zones thus allowing quick intervention. Two new drugs, i.e., ivermectin and albendazole, have been shown to be highly effective in the management of microfilariasis due to Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori thus greatly expanding a therapeutic arsenal once limited to diethylcarbamazine. The current eradication strategy is designed to break the chain of transmission in populations exposed to the risk of infection by administering a single dose of two drugs yearly for five to six years. Combined treatment using albendazole plus ivermectin or albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine has resulted in near-zero microfilaremia levels for at least one year. Based on these new developments, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution calling on member states to work for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. Thanks to the donation of albendazole and ivermectin by SmithKline Beecham and Merck & Co. respectively, the WHO has started a worldwide program and set up task force including a wide-range of actors in different fields for eradication of this disease affecting 120 million people.", "Year": "2000", "Authors": "Karam, M., Ottesen, E.", "Journal": "Medecine Tropicale", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "60(3)", "Pages": "291-296", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity -

Antigenemia was determined in 1322 persons by means of the Og4C3 antibody capture assay. Prevalence of antigenemia by village ranged from 61.7% to 98.2% and did not vary by sex. Antigen level increased with transmission potential among the 4 villages with measured transmission potential (r(2)=.945; P=.028). Antigenemia was associated positively with age in villages with the lowest annual transmission potentials (45 and 404 infective larvae/year; P<.001), but was distributed evenly across age groups in villages with increased transmission (1485 and 2518 infective larvae/year).

Working Version: September 1999. Overview: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring disease that has a major social and economic impact in Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific and parts of the Americas. Until recently, little could be done to relieve the suffering and disability caused by this disease. Today, however, significant advances have been made in understanding both the disease and its control. A global coalition has been forged among many organizations, each with a different mandate but all having a common goal: to tackle the wide-ranging and complex process of science and practice that will result in the elimination of LF as a public health problem1 from the world. A strong start was made in 1997 when the World Health Assembly passed a resolution calling for ' ... the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem ... '. Following this, WHO, with support from organizations including donor countries, the World Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began developing a coalition to eliminate the disease. The following year the coalition was given a powerful boost when SmithKiine Beech am announced its commitment to form a unique private-sector/public-sector collaboration with WHO to support the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. The two organizations pledged to work together closely to undertake this massive international public health effort. Subsequently, Merck & Co., Inc. pledged to expand its ongoing Mectizan\u00ae Donation Program for onchocerciasis to cover treatment of lymphatic filariasis in all African countries where the two diseases occur together. Individually, none of these organizations can eliminate LF; but by working together, and working through the Ministries of Health in the endemic countries, we believe that it can be done. Not all partners will work in each country, but, together, we hope to develop partnerships that will cover all of the affected countries and ensure an extraordinarily positive impact on many millions of lives.", "Year": "1999", "Authors": "World Health Organization", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "WHO Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination (CPE/CEE/FIL) Control Prevention and Eradication", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "64", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "Not a scientific paper - not checked", "Activity - key words": "MDA", "Other keywords": "partners,strategies, vector control, DEC, albendazole, Ivermectin, DEC-fortified salt,", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_1738 Building partnerships for lymphatic filariasis.

The advantage of the assay is that the biotinylated PCR product is visualized following hybridization with specific probes which are immobilized on plate wells (microtiter plate hybridization). This method has been previously evaluated in a field study and was found to be sensitive and specific for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. In the current study, the microtiter plate hybridization PCR method was evaluated by using blood specimens from malaria patients. All of 36 cases of falciparum malaria, 26 of 27 cases of vivax malaria, all of 11 cases of ovale malaria, and 2 cases of malariae malaria were diagnosed species specifically by the PCR method. There were four smear-negative, PCR-positive cases that seemed to correspond to the convalescent stage of malaria. In contrast, 30 cases for which the diagnosis of malaria has been excluded on the basis of microscopy and clinical courses showed negative PCR results. By comparing parasite densities and PCR results following antimalarial treatment of some patients, it was revealed that the PCR results largely paralleled the parasite densities and that PCR could detect as few as 10 parasites per microliter of blood. We conclude that this PCR method is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of all four parasite species and can serve as a useful supplement to microscopy for the clinical management of malaria.", "Year": "1995", "Authors": "Kimura, M., Miyake, H., Kim, H.S., Tanabe, M., Arai, M., Kawai, S., Yamane, A., Wataya, Y.", "Journal": "Journal of Clinical Microbiology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "33(9)", "Pages": "2342-2346", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "PCR, convalescent stage, malaria parasite, RNA, acute stage", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Species-Specific_PCR_Detection_of_Malaria_Parasites_by_Microtiter_Plate_Hybridization:_Clinical_Study_with_Malaria_Patients.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Species-Specific_PCR_Detection_of_Malaria_Parasites_by_Microtiter_Plate_Hybridization:_Clinical_Study_with_Malaria_Patients.txt"}, {"ID": "1815", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1291", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Meeting Reports", "Title": "Development and validation of sampling strategies for xenomonitoring of infection in Culex vector by PCR as a surveillance tool for assessing post-MDA situation of Lymphatic filariasis elimination Programme (Funding: Gates Foundation)", "Description": "Document also contains meeting agenda and attendees 'Xenomonitoring for Lymphatic Filariasis' Washington DC", "Year": "2011", "Authors": "Subramanian, S., Sadanandanae, C., Vasuki, V., Srividya, A., AbdulKhader, M.S.M., Krishnamoorthy, K., Jambulingam, P.", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "post-MDA, monitoring, evaluation, surveillance tool, mosquito, PCR assay", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "India", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Development_and_validation_of_sampling_strategies_for_xenomonitoring_of_infection_in_Culex_vector_by_PCR_as_a_surveillance_tool_for_assessing_post-MDA_situation_of_Lymphatic_filariasis_elimination_Programme_(Funding:_Gates_Foundation).txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Development_and_validation_of_sampling_strategies_for_xenomonitoring_of_infection_in_Culex_vector_by_PCR_as_a_surveillance_tool_for_assessing_post-MDA_situation_of_Lymphatic_filariasis_elimination_Programme_(Funding:_Gates_Foundation).txt"}, {"ID": "1816", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1292", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Reports and Results", "Title": "Monitoring of prevalence of infection in vectors in an era of elimination", "Description": "Abstract for \"Estimating Prevalence in mosquitoes,; sampling strategies and use of PoolScreen\"", "Year": "", "Authors": "Unnasch, T.R., Katholi, C.R.", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "1", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "monitoring, prevalence, pool screening, transmission intensity, sensitive, sampling model", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Monitoring_of_prevalence_of_infection_in_vectors_in_an_era_of_elimination.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Monitoring_of_prevalence_of_infection_in_vectors_in_an_era_of_elimination.txt"}, {"ID": "1819", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1296", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Meeting Reports", "Title": "Executive Summary Introduction Xenomonitoring: Sampling issues for Lymphatic filariasis", "Description": "Extract from meeting report.

A much better fit is obtained with a truncated negative-binomial distribution, the k exponent of which is estimated to 0.3. This value does not seem to be affected by the endemic level, by microfilaricide mass-treatments or by the blood-sample volume. This result has immediate practical interests: it facilitates a posteriori comparisons between surveys in which different volumes of blood were examined; and at a given density, it allows calculating the change in sensitivity (detection rate) as a function of a change in the volume of blood examined, thus allowing better a priori planning of surveys. The paper provides the formulae required to calculate k, or, given k, to calculate the expected numbers in the various density classes. It also provides nomograms giving estimates of the true mean M and of the detection rate TD, given any one of the three following observations, made on observed positives: the median Dmf. 50, the mean m, or the percentage P1 having only 1 mf. The effect of changing the volume of blood on the rate of detection can then be read easily from the nomogram.

The mechanisms involved in this differential responsiveness appear to reflect different T-cell cytokine response patterns. Asymptomatic patients with the clinically silent presentation of asymptomatic microfilaraemia who have been previously described as being \u2018 immunosuppressed \u2019 with respect to their generating pro-inflammatory (Thl -type) immune responses to parasite antigen, are now recognized to be fully responsive to parasite antigen but to produce cytokines and mediators that have primarily anti-inflammatory (Th2-like) effects. Studies with immunodeficient mice have indicated the existence of two alternative pathways to the development of lymphatic pathology one dependent on the induction of inflammatory reactions by the host immune response, the other entirely independent of the immune system and reflecting the direct actions of the parasite or its products on the lymphatics. As histopathology of affected human lymphatics is consistent with this hypothesis, it may be that the lymphatic pathology seen normally in the amicrofilaraemic, highly immunoresponsive infected patients derives from inflammation induced by immune responses to parasite antigen, whereas the lymphatic pathology sometimes seen coexisting with the \u2018 immunosuppressed \u2019 state of asymptomatic microfilaraemia actually reflects lymphatic damage that is not immunologically mediated. Though little information exists about the natural history of lymphatic filariasis, there is no evidence for an inevitable progression from one clinical form to another. Instead, there appears to be a definite plasticity in the response that depends on prior (? pre-natal) and current exposure to the parasite as well as on the immunomodulatory effects it induces. This plasticity does not appear to be complete, however, as there is no evidence that a chronically infected host who has developed strong pro-inflammatory immune responses can subsequently become sufficiently down-regulated to support an asymptomatic microfilaraemia type of infection. Another possible constraint to the plasticity of the clinical and immunological responses may be the genetic determination of certain unusual syndromes, such as tropical pulmonary eosinophilia or TPE, though this hypothesis remains to be proven.", "Year": "1992", "Authors": "Ottesen, E.A.", "Journal": "Parasitology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "104(S1)", "Pages": "S71-S79", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182000075259", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "immunological perspective, infection, disease,", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "The_Welcome_Trust_Lecture_Infection_and_disease_in_lymphatic_filariasis_an_immunological_perspective.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/The_Welcome_Trust_Lecture_Infection_and_disease_in_lymphatic_filariasis_an_immunological_perspective.txt"}, {"ID": "1887", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1497", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "1487; 3006", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Lymphatic filariasis: Diagnosis and pathogenesis", "Description": "", "Year": "1993", "Authors": "WHO Expert Committee on Filariasis: Dennis, D.T., Dreyer, G., Ismail, M.M., Kumaraswami, V., Mak, J.W., Mataika, J.U., Ottesen, E.A., Piessens, W.F., Rajagopalan, P.K., Southgate, B.A., Huijin, Z.", "Journal": "Bulletin of the World Health Organization", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "71(2)", "Pages": "135-141", "View_at_Publisher": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2393467/pdf/bullwho00036-0001.pdf", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "Strictly speaking this is Open via PMC (Author Manuscript) only but Scopus tags as Open and is low risk", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "diagnosis, immunodiagnosis, antibody-detection assays, control,", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": ""}, {"ID": "1888", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1498", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Lymphatic abnormalities in human filariasis as depicted by lymphangioscintigraphy", "Description": "Background: Investigation into filarial lymphedema has been hampered by the lack of a simple, safe, and easily repeated test to image the peripheral lymphatic system. Recent refinements in radionuclide lymphangioscintigraphy have established this noninvasive technique as the initial procedure of choice for visualizing lymphatics. Accordingly, we applied lymphangioscintigraphy to patients with filariasis and, for purposes of interpretation, compared the findings with those in patients with nonfilarial lymphedema. Methods: Thirty-three patients with classic symptoms or signs consistent with acute or chronic filariasis underwent lymphangioscintigraphy, and the findings were compared with those in five patients without lymphatic dysfunction and in 50 other patients with primary or secondary lymphedema without exposure to filariasis. Results: As in patients with nonfilarial lymphedema, seintigraphic abnormalities in the 33 patients with filariasis included delayed or absent tracer transport of the radiotracer (25 patients), tortuous and bizarre deep lymphatics (seven patients), dermal diffusion (15 patients), retrograde tracer flow (six patients), and faint or absent regional nodal visualization (14 patients). Even in patients with long-standing filarial lymphedema, peripheral trunks were often visualized (at least in part), and regional nodes and more central lymphatics sometimes filled after light exercise. In some of the latter patients, however, discrete lymphatic trunks were not detected.

Selected examples are considered from viral and parasitic infections (arboviruses, malaria, the leishmaniases, filariases, Chagas Disease and schistosomiasis) where disease patterns have been directly or indirectly influenced by loss of natural tropical forests. A wide range of activities have resulted in deforestation. These include colonisation and settlement, transmigrant programmes, logging, agricultural activities to provide for cash crops, mining, hydropower development and fuelwood collection. Each activity influences the prevalence, incidence and distribution of vector-borne disease. Three main regions are considered - South America, West & Central Africa and South-East Asia. In each, documented changes in vector ecology and behaviour and disease pattern have occurred. Such changes result from human activity at the forest interface and within the forest. They include both deforestation and reafforestation programmes. Deforestation, or activities associated with it, have produced new habitats for Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and have caused malaria epidemics in South America. The different species complexes in South-East Asia (A. dirus, A. minimus, A. balabacensis) have been affected in different ways by forest clearance with different impacts on malaria incidence. The ability of zoophilic vectors to adapt to human blood as an alternative source of food and to become associated with human dwellings (peridomestic behaviour) have influenced the distribution of the leishmaniases in South America. Certain species of sandflies (Lutzomyia intermedia, Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmam), which were originally zoophilic and sylvatic, have adapted to feeding on humans in peridomestic and even periurban situations. The changes in behaviour of reservoir hosts and the ability of pathogens to adapt to new reservoir hosts in the newly-created habitats also influence the patterns of disease. In anthroponotic infections, such as Plasmodium, Onchocerca and Wuchereria, changes in disease patterns and vector ecology may be more difficult to detect. Detailed knowledge of vector species and species complexes is needed in relation to changing climate associated with deforestation. The distributions of the Anopheles gambiae and Simulium damnosum species complexes in West Africa are examples. There have been detailed longitudinal studies of Anopheles gambiae populations in different ecological zones of West Africa. Studies on Simulium damnosum cytoforms (using chromosome identification methods) in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme were necessary to detect changes in distribution of species in relation to changed habitats.

Until recently, little could be done to relieve the suffering and disability caused by this disease. Today, however, significant advances have been made in understanding both the disease and its control. A global coalition has been forged among many organizations, each with a different mandate but all having a common goal: to tackle the wide-ranging and complex process of science and practice that will result in the elimination of LF as a public health problem1 from the world. A strong start was made in 1997 when the World Health Assembly passed a resolution calling for ' ... the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem ... '. Following this, WHO, with support from organizations including donor countries, the World Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began developing a coalition to eliminate the disease. The following year the coalition was given a powerful boost when SmithKiine Beech am announced its commitment to form a unique private-sector/public-sector collaboration with WHO to support the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. The two organizations pledged to work together closely to undertake this massive international public health effort. Subsequently, Merck & Co., Inc. pledged to expand its ongoing Mectizan\u00ae Donation Program for onchocerciasis to cover treatment of lymphatic filariasis in all African countries where the two diseases occur together. Individually, none of these organizations can eliminate LF; but by working together, and working through the Ministries of Health in the endemic countries, we believe that it can be done. Not all partners will work in each country, but, together, we hope to develop partnerships that will cover all of the affected countries and ensure an extraordinarily positive impact on many millions of lives.", "Year": "1999", "Authors": "World Health Organization", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "World Health Organization", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "50", "View_at_Publisher": "http://www.who.int/lymphatic_filariasis/resources/who_fil_99.198/en/", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "MDA", "Other keywords": "strategic plan, vector control, partnership", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "3 hard copies exist with different PacELF IDs", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": ""}, {"ID": "1915", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1542", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "1368", "Category": "Other", "Title": "Managing morbidity and preventing disability in the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis", "Description": "National elimination programmes should focus on managing morbidity and preventing disability in order to achieve the objectives of the global programme, which include providing care to those already affected by lymphatic filariasis even after transmission has been interrupted.

MDAs are stopped only if the survey demonstrates statistically that antigenemia prevalence is <0.1%. The guidelines for the LQAS survey are to select a systematic sample of 3000 school entrants and to conclude that MDAs can be stopped only if no child is among the 3000 is found to be antigenemic.

Therefore, in order to arrive at a simple procedure, four different methods (A, B, C and D) were tried for the extraction of DNA from mosquitoes infected with filarial parasite, Brugia malayi. Method D was found to be as efficient as the current procedure for the extraction of DNA from a single microfilaria in pools of 25 mosquitoes and the DNA was suitable for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, yielding a band of 322 base pairs with primers specific for B. malayi. Method D involved drying and crushing the mosquitoes to a powder, which was homogenized in 100 \u03bcl TE buffer, vortexed, boiled for 10 min, centrifuged at 14 000 r.p.m. for 10 min, and the supernatant used for the PCR assay. Dot-blot hybridization confirmed the specificity of the PCR amplified fragment. The DNA extracted by this method was stable for about 1 year. When comparing with the standard method, the cost of a single PCR reaction, inclusive of DNA extraction, was reduced by 50% and the hands on time was minimized fivefold.

Inflammatory responses are thought to be generated by either the parasite, the immune response, or opportunistic infection. We show that soluble extracts of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi can induce potent inflammatory responses, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and nitric oxide (NO) from macrophages. The active component is heat stable, reacts positively in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, and can be inhibited by polymyxin B. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and NO responses were not induced in macrophages from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-nonresponsive C3H/HeJ mice. The production of TNF-\u03b1 after chemotherapy of microfilariae was also only detected in LPS-responsive C3H/HeN mice, suggesting that signaling through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is necessary for these responses. We also show that CD14 is required for optimal TNF-\u03b1 responses at low concentrations. Together, these results suggest that extracts of B. malayi contain bacterial LPS. Extracts from the rodent filaria, Acanthocheilonema viteae, which is not infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria found in the majority of filarial parasites, failed to induce any inflammatory responses from macrophages, suggesting that the source of bacterial LPS in extracts of B. malayi is the Wolbachia endosymbiont. Wolbachia extracts derived from a mosquito cell line induced similar LPS-dependent TNF-\u03b1 and NO responses from C3H/HeN macrophages, which were eliminated after tetracycline treatment of the bacteria. Thus, Wolbachia LPS may be one of the major mediators of inflammatory pathogenesis in filarial nematode disease.", "Year": "2000", "Authors": "Taylor, M.J., Cross, H.F., Bilo, K.", "Journal": "Journal of Experimental Medicine", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "191(8)", "Pages": "1429-1435", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1084/jem.191.8.1429", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "endotoxin, pathogenesis, symbiosis, lipopolysaccharide, Wolbachia", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Inflammatory_responses_induced_by_the_filarial_nematode_Brugia_malayi_are_mediated_by_lipopolysaccharide-like_activity_from_endosymbiotic_Wolbachia_bacteria.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Inflammatory_responses_induced_by_the_filarial_nematode_Brugia_malayi_are_mediated_by_lipopolysaccharide-like_activity_from_endosymbiotic_Wolbachia_bacteria.txt"}, {"ID": "1996", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1697", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Side reactions following ivermectin therapy in high density bancroftian microfilaraemics", "Description": "Side reactions following ivermectin treatment were evaluated in sixty males with high density bancroftian microfilaremia (GM 1388/ml).

Itchy rashes, lymphatic nodules and raised alkaline phosphatase level were also observed in some patients.

Bacteria are unable to repopulate nematode tissues up to 18 months after depletion, suggesting these effects may be permanent.

The filarial nematodes that cause these diseases are transmitted by blood-feeding insects and produce chronic and long-term infection through suppression of host immunity. Disease pathogenesis is linked to host inflammation invoked by the death of the parasite, causing hydrocoele, lymphoedema, and elephantiasis in lymphatic filariasis, and skin disease and blindness in onchocerciasis. Most filarial species that infect people co-exist in mutualistic symbiosis with Wolbachia bacteria, which are essential for growth, development, and survival of their nematode hosts. These endosymbionts contribute to inflammatory disease pathogenesis and are a target for doxycycline therapy, which delivers macrofilaricidal activity, improves pathological outcomes, and is effective as monotherapy. Drugs to treat filariasis include diethylcarbamazine, ivermectin, and albendazole, which are used mostly in combination to reduce microfilariae in blood (lymphatic filariasis) and skin (onchocerciasis). Global programmes for control and elimination have been developed to provide sustained delivery of drugs to affected communities to interrupt transmission of disease and ultimately eliminate this burden on public health.", "Year": "2010", "Authors": "Taylor, M.J., Hoerauf, A., Bockarie, M.", "Journal": "The Lancet", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "376(9747)", "Pages": "1175-1185", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60586-7", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open via Publisher", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity -

A total of 3,683 children aged 5-12 years attending 27 primary schools in 13 Pacific Island countries were surveyed along with school environmental data. Stool samples were collected from 1996 children (54.2%) and analysed for ova and helminths. Total prevalence of helminthiasis was 32.8%. Anaemia prevalence was 12.4%. Children with helminthiasis and anaemia were found to be 8.7 times more likely to be stunted and 4.3 times more likely to be underweight than non-anaemic and non-infected children. Four significant environmental influences on helminthiasis were identified: (1) an inadequate water supply; (2); availability of a school canteen; (3) regular water/sanitation maintenance regimes; and (4) overcrowded classrooms.

Typically, they only appear in the human bloodstream at nighttime, synchronised with their mosquito vectors. In Polynesia and parts of Southeast Asia, free of nocturnal vectors, they are found at all hours, and each population biorhythm differs. Through a geometrical approach, we explain this circadian diversity by a single, dominant mutation: the clocks of individual parasites are set at midnight (ubiquitous) or at 2 p.m. Compared to other circadian genes, this mutation must be very old, as it is shared by four biologically remote genera of parasites. This seniority sheds new light on several theoretical and practical aspects of vector-parasite temporal relations.Hardcopy is a draft document", "Year": "2004", "Authors": "Pichon, G.

Ten plants in every patch of Pandanus plantation were sampled at each village. Among 23,049 mosquito larvae collected from Upolu, 77% were the filariasis vector Aedes (Finlaya) samoanus, 17.7% were Ae.(Fin.)oceanicus and 5.3% were Ac.(Fin.)tutuilae. Out of 6981 larvae taken in Savai'i, 23.2% were Ae.samoanus, 67.6% Ae.oceanicus and 9.2% Ae.tutuilae. When larval counts per plant were analysed for each district, Ae.samoanus was found to predominate in Pandanus in Upolu and Ae.oceanicus in Savai'i. However, the adult density of Ae.samoanus was higher in Savai'i and this was attributed to the large areas of forests with Freycinetia for Ae.samoanus breeding. In Pandanus in Savai'i the number of Ae.samoanus was negligible. In Upolu, with more urbanization and larger plantations, there was greater breeding of Ae.samoanus in Pandanus. Two control trials were conducted against Ae.samoanus larvae in Pandanus, one using a sand culture of the parasitic nematode Romanomermis culicivorax and the other with temephos, an organophosphate insecticide. While R.culicivorax did not adapt to the leaf axil habitat, all plants were without larvae for 5 weeks after treatment with temephos.", "Year": "1992", "Authors": "Samarawickrema, W.A., Sone, F., Self, L.S., Cummings, R.F., Paulson, G.S.", "Journal": "Medical and Veterinary Entomology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "6(4)", "Pages": "367-370", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "Aedes samoanus, Aedes oceanicus, Aedes tutuilae, Pandanus, frecinetia, Romanomermis sulicivorax, temephos, mosquito larvae, vectors", "Other keywords": "larval density,", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Distribution_of_breeding_and_control_of_the_filariasis_vector_Aedes_samoanus_in_leaf_axils_of_Pandanus_in_Samoa.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Distribution_of_breeding_and_control_of_the_filariasis_vector_Aedes_samoanus_in_leaf_axils_of_Pandanus_in_Samoa.txt"}, {"ID": "2161", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1066", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Other", "Title": "Samoa MDA 1999 Questionnaire: Monitoring form albendazole and DEC co-administration", "Description": "", "Year": "1999", "Authors": "", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "1", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "MDA", "Other keywords": "DEC, albendazole,", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Samoa_MDA_1999_Questionnaire:_Monitoring_form_albendazole_and_DEC_co-administration.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Samoa_MDA_1999_Questionnaire:_Monitoring_form_albendazole_and_DEC_co-administration.txt"}, {"ID": "2162", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1143", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Guidelines and Instructional Materials", "Title": "Teaching Guide for Health Personnel and School Teachers in Samoa on Control of Subperiodic Bancroftian filariasis", "Description": "Booklet for district nurses, health inspectors, health educators and teachers involved in public health services.

The mf rate was correlated with both infection and infective rates of Ae. polynesiensis in Upolu, but not of Ae. samoanus. In Upolu, Ae. polynesiensis was apparently the major vector. It was relatively more abundant in more cultivated and populated areas, along the northern coast of Upolu, except Apia town area. In Savaii, Ae. samoanus predominated over Ae. polynesiensis except in \"plantation\" villages. Relatively high biting densities and rates of infection and infectivity indicated that Ae. samoanus was not less important than Ae. polynesiensis as a vector in Savaii. Ae. samoanus preferred natural vegetation, in contrast to Ae. polynesiensis which was found near human habitations in cultivated land. There was no difference between the biting densities of Ae. polynesiensis in \"coastal\" and \"inland\" villages, indicating that crab holes (numerous only in some coastal villages) may not influence the density of Ae. polynesiensis. Higher mf rates were associated with villages where Ae. polynesiensis, rather than Ae. samoanus, was dominant, indicating that Ae. polynesiensis was generally a more efficient vector. In the former villages, the difference in mf rates between males and females was smaller than in the latter, probably reflecting a difference in biting habits of the vectors. Ae. polynesiensis infections were recorded in plantations over 2 km from any village, suggesting that both habitats were foci of transmission.", "Year": "1987", "Authors": "Samarawickrema, W.A., Kimura, E., Spears, G.F.S., Penaia, L., Sone, F., Paulson, G.S., Cummings, R.F.", "Journal": "Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "81(1)", "Pages": "129-135", "View_at_Publisher": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0035-9203(87)90304-X", "Work_Location": "Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "entomology, Aedes polynesiensis, Aedes samoanus, vector, efficient vector", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Distribution_of_vectors,_transmission_indices_and_microfilaria_rates_of_subperiodic_Wuchereria_bancrofti_in_relation_to_village_ecotypes_in_Samoa.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Distribution_of_vectors,_transmission_indices_and_microfilaria_rates_of_subperiodic_Wuchereria_bancrofti_in_relation_to_village_ecotypes_in_Samoa.txt"}, {"ID": "2178", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1411", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "939", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Observations on Culex quinquefasciatus Say in relation to transmission of filariasis due to subperiodic Wuchereria bancrofti in Samoa", "Description": "", "Year": "1992", "Authors": "Samarawickrema, W.A., Sone, F., Paulson, G.S., Kimura, E., Uchida, K., Cummings, R.F.", "Journal": "Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "86(5)", "Pages": "517-522", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "epidemiology, Culex quinquefasciatus, subperiodic, inefficient vector", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Observations_on_Culex_quinquefasciatus_Say_in_relation_to_transmission_of_filariasis_due_to_subperiodic_Wuchereria_bancrofti_in_Samoa.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Observations_on_Culex_quinquefasciatus_Say_in_relation_to_transmission_of_filariasis_due_to_subperiodic_Wuchereria_bancrofti_in_Samoa.txt"}, {"ID": "2179", "Source Collection": "NGSK", "SiteNum": "1412", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC Ichimori", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Filarial infection in vector mosquitos after mass drug administration in Western Samoa", "Description": "In order to control filariasis in Western Samoa, the first round of mass administration of diethylcarbamazine was carried out between 1965 and 1966, without undertaking any vector control measures. Four yr of post control entomologic evaluation has revealed that the infection rate has dropped from 8.35% to 0.61% (1/14 of pre control rate) in Aedes (Stegomyia) polynesiensis and 4.47% to 0.26% (1/17 of pre control rate) in Aedes (Finlaya) samoanus; and the infective rate has dropped from 2.95% to 0.070% (1.42 of pre control rate) in Ae. polynesiensis and 0.26% to 0 in Ae. samoanus. More reduction was observed in the infective rate than the infection rate, presumably because of a remarkable decrease in the number of filarial larvae in infected mosquitos. It is suggested that, for the entomologic evaluation of filariasis control, the infective rate should be preferred to the infection rate. Of the three infective Ae. polynesiensis detected after the campaign, one was found three mth after its completion and the other two at least 1 yr later.

It was found that DDT indoor spraying alone had little impact on interruption of malaria transmission.

The main strategy is to interrupt transmission through integrated preventive chemotherapy, using mass drug administration to treat entire populations at risk of the disease, with a combination of albendazole plus ivermectin or albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine administered as a single dose once a year for at least 5 years. Because ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine can cause serious adverse effects in people infected with Loa loa causing loiasis (African eye worm), an endemic disease in a large part of central Africa, the current guidelines for preventive chemotherapy contain no recommendation for areas where lymphatic filariasis and loiasis are co-endemic but where onchocerciasis is hypo-endemic or non-endemic. Consequently, mass drug administration to eliminate lymphatic filariasis using the combination of medicines recommended by the World Health Organization could thus far not be implemented in these communities. In order to meet the 2020 goal, it has become urgent to develop an alternative strategy for interrupting transmission of lymphatic filariasis adapted to the specific situation of co-endemicity with Loa loa. This strategy could potentially include both medication and vector control. The milestones for the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis 2010\u20132020 stipulate that by 2012, a provisional strategy for interrupting lymphatic filariasis transmission in loiasis-endemic countries should have been developed; and that by 2013, a revised strategy for interrupting lymphatic filariasis transmission should have been implemented in all loiasis-endemic countries. In June 2011, a preliminary meeting on Loa loa in Lusaka, Zambia, proposed the following provisional strategies for eliminating lymphatic filariasis in areas where Loa loa is co-endemic: integrated vector management as the main strategy, and mapping of lymphatic filariasis and Loa loa at the lowest possible administrative level to potentially identify small areas that can be treated for lymphatic filariasis.", "Year": "2012", "Authors": "World Health Organization", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "World Health Organization", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "25", "View_at_Publisher": "http://www.who.int/lymphatic_filariasis/resources/who_htm_ntd_pct_2012.6/en/", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Open", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "MDA, vector control, mapping", "Other keywords": "Oncho, Loiasis, Malaria, albendazole, ivermectin", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Multicountry Global", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_2767 WHO 2012 Provisional strategy for interrupting lymphatic filariasis transmission in loiasis-endemic countries.pdf", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_PDF_file_name": "PacELF_2767_WHO_2012_Provisional_strategy_for_interrupting_lymphatic_filariasis_transmission_in_loiasis-endemic_countries.pdf", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_2767_WHO_2012_Provisional_strategy_for_interrupting_lymphatic_filariasis_transmission_in_loiasis-endemic_countries.pdf"}, {"ID": "2769", "Source Collection": "WHO", "SiteNum": "309", "HardcopyLocation2020": "WHO HQ Geneva", "LocationDetail": "WHO Building L, S1, archives, top shelf", "Type": "Electronic/Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "YES", "Keep or Drop?": "KEEP", "ID_dup": "1181; 1827; 511; 1550; 2997", "Category": "Meeting Reports", "Title": "Defining the Roles of Vector Control and Xenomonitoring in the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.

The meeting also provided an opportunity to consider the possible role of monitoring filariasis prevalence in the human population via vector sampling and assays. The term xenomonitoring was introduced for this approach. The GPELF was launched in 2000, based on two strategies: stopping transmission and alleviation of disability due to the disease. Currently the GPELF depends largely on mass drug administration (MDA) to interrupt transmission of filaria parasites: Brugia and Wuchereria bancrofti.

Studies from 1967 to the present conducted in Brazil, Japan, Tanzania, India, China, and Taiwan involving administration of DEC salt for 18 days to 1 year, have shown this intervention to be effective for both bancroftian and brugian filariasis, as measured by reductions in both microfilarial density and positivity, and in some studies through reduction in mosquito positivity rates as well. Furthermore, studies suggest specific advantages from using DEC salt, including lack of side effects, particularly for bancroftian filariasis, and ability to reduce prevalence below 1 % when used in conjunction with standard regimens of DEC tablets. However, use of DEC salt as a control tool suffers from a concern that health authorities might find it difficult to manage a programme involving a commodity such as salt. In the past decade, the very successful global efforts to eliminate iodine deficiency through universal salt iodization have demonstrated that partnership with the salt industry can be both successful and effective as a public health tool. Use of DEC salt can be most successfully implemented in areas in which (a) there is adequate governmental support for its use and for elimination of filariasis, (b) filariasis-endemic areas are clearly defined, (c) political leaders, health officials and the salt industry agree that DEC salt is an appropriate intervention, (d) the salt industry is well-organized and has known distribution patterns, (e) a successful national salt iodization effort exists, (f) a monitoring system exists that ensures adequacy of salt iodine content during production and that can also measure household coverage, and (g) measurement of impact on transmission of LF with the new antigen or filarial DNA detection methods can be established. There are advantages and disadvantages of using DEC-fortified salt compared with other interventions for LF elimination programmes, but rather than being considered as a 'competing' intervention, DEC salt should be seen as an additional option. Indeed, it is likely that many countries will derive maximal benefit from the synergistic effects of combining different intervention strategies in their national programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.", "Year": "2000", "Authors": "Houston, R.", "Journal": "Parasitology", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "121 (SUPPL.)", "Pages": "S161-S173", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Multicountry Global", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "DEC", "Other keywords": "Cost benefit analysis", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "", "PDF_file_name": "", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "Salt_fortified_with_diethylcarbamazine_(DEC)_as_an_effective_intervention_for_lymphatic_filariasis,_with_lessons_learned_from_salt_iodization_programmes.txt", "download_url": "/statics/data/Salt_fortified_with_diethylcarbamazine_(DEC)_as_an_effective_intervention_for_lymphatic_filariasis,_with_lessons_learned_from_salt_iodization_programmes.txt"}, {"ID": "2898", "Source Collection": "WHO", "SiteNum": "443", "HardcopyLocation2020": "WHO HQ Geneva", "LocationDetail": "WHO Building L, S1, archives, bottom shelves", "Type": "Hardcopy", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Scientific Papers", "Title": "Ensuring supplies of quality diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC)", "Description": "In 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) made a commitment to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.

Yet there are robust, low-cost and effective public health interventions that can relieve that burden and enable people in poor settings to lead better lives. Preventive anthelminthic chemotherapy aims at using available anthelminthic drugs either alone or in combination as a public health tool for preventing morbidity due to more than one form of helminthiasis at once. The emphasis of preventive chemotherapy is therefore on the best, coordinated use of drugs rather than on specific forms of helminthiasis. The greatest challenge is to expand regular anthelminthic drug coverage as a public health intervention to reach all at risk of morbidity induced by helminth diseases. Working to achieve the objectives of a national programme for the control of Neglected Tropical Diseases by implementing preventive chemotherapy requires regular and careful monitoring of drug coverage. Without reliable information about drug coverage programme managers and their staff cannot monitor programme performance efficiently. Managers must know how many people in need of treatment recieved the treatment, when and where it was offered.

Final Report.", "Description": "Executive Summary  There has been much effort by the Samoa government through its Ministry of Health to control Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) disease in the country. It has proven to be a very debilitating, disfiguring and stigmatized neglected tropical disease affecting Samoa. Since the early 1950s Samoa has collaborated with development partners such as WHO and later JICA, in this endeavour. Since 1999, a renewed regional effort with PacELF to push LF elimination, had seen several rounds of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) country-wide with at least eight MDAs implemented in Samoa itself.  \nIn accordance with surveillance methods recommended by WHO, the Ministry of Health carried out its first transmission assessment survey for LF in 2013. It discovered the North West Upolu (NWU) area, one of the three enumeration units (EU) in the country, continued transmission of LF microfilarial worms. Two further rounds of MDA were then implemented within this area alone, the first in February 2015 and the last one in April 2017.  \nThis year, Samoa implemented its second transmission assessment survey, to assess whether or not LF had been interrupted in the failed EU of NWU, which had received two MDAs and also whether there was recrudesence in Savaii and other parts of Upolu. Methodology for the survey was kept as similar as possible for comparisons. However, for antigenic testing, ICT cards were replaced with Filriasis Test Strips (FTS). The sampled population were those of grades one and two (six and seven year old) children from all primary schools around the country. As an added feature of the LF TAS survey this year it was agreed to implement alongside it, the Soil Transmitted Helminthic (STH) survey as an initial attempt to gather much needed data for the status of Helminthic infestation amongst the Samoan population. This used primary school children in grades three and four (ages 8 and 9 years) and it utilized the Kato Katz test to identify the different helminthes that may be present. \nSurvey results for the 2017 LF TAS saw all Enumeration Units AUA + ROU; NWU and Savaii having rather significant recrudescence with LF prevalence rates of 1.43%; 6.79% and 5.25% respectively. Despite the difference in tests used and the slight drop in actual sampled number of the population used, LF prevalence rates were indeed profound and shows a definite rise in LF transmission continuing country-wide in Samoa. At this stage, there is much needed work to be done for the realization of LF elimination, in Samoa. \nSurvey results for STH survey indicates infestation amongst school children, which however needs further detailed data which was missing in the current survey. Prevalence results cannot be calculated as a significant number of samples were not processed due to unforeseen difficulties with Laboratory staff availability. At best, this survey serves to indicate the need for better planning and perhaps a separation of these two surveys. It also highlighted Laboratory inadequacies for the processing of stool specimen, as an injunction for other significant Public Health infectious disease surveillance such as typhoid contact tracing. \nIn effect, Public Health measures for control and elimination of LF as well as addressing other PH diseases of significance must be strengthened urgently and simultaneously.", "Year": "2017", "Authors": "Government of Samoa, Ministry of Health (Lesjack M, Vaai-Nielsen S, Asoiva Pulueta M, Loau S).", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "32", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Samoa", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_3126 Government of Samoa Ministry of Health 2017 TAS 2017 and STH Survey Final Report", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "PacELF_3126_Government_of_Samoa_Ministry_of_Health_2017_TAS_2017_and_STH_Survey_Final_Report", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_3126_Government_of_Samoa_Ministry_of_Health_2017_TAS_2017_and_STH_Survey_Final_Report"}, {"ID": "3127", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Action/Strategic Plans", "Title": "NATIONAL ACTION PLAN TO ELIMINATE YMPHATIC FILARIASIS IN SAMOA 2018 - 2024", "Description": "", "Year": "2017", "Authors": "Government of Samoa, Ministry of Health", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "22", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Samoa", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_3127 Government of Samoa Minstry of Health 2017 NATIONAL ACTION PLAN TO ELIMINATE YMPHATIC FILARIASIS IN SAMOA 2018 - 2024", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "PacELF_3127_Government_of_Samoa_Minstry_of_Health_2017_NATIONAL_ACTION_PLAN_TO_ELIMINATE_YMPHATIC_FILARIASIS_IN_SAMOA_2018_-_2024", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_3127_Government_of_Samoa_Minstry_of_Health_2017_NATIONAL_ACTION_PLAN_TO_ELIMINATE_YMPHATIC_FILARIASIS_IN_SAMOA_2018_-_2024"}, {"ID": "3128", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Reports and Results", "Title": "Lymphatic Filariasiss Transmission Assessment Survey 2013 Final Report 23 July 2013", "Description": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. Samoa has come a long way in trying to eliminate LF from the country in the form of country wide MDAs which first begun in 1962.  Since 1999, about eight rounds of MDAs with varying coverage rates had been completed in Samoa.  This year, Samoa would be assessing whether or not LF had been interrupted following the series of MDAs.  Using ICT cards, antigen prevalence would be assessed in the 3 regions of Samoa namely North West Upolu, Savaii and Rest of Upolu combined with Apia Urban Area.  To out rightly state that LF had been interrupted, children born after the MDAs would not be infected with LF if MDAs were effective.  Thus, in this Transmission Assessment Survey, children of all primary schools in grades 1 and 2 are targeted.  WHO argues that antigen prevalence of <0.5% would be too low to sustain transmission of LF in a country or region.  The result of the survey suggests that EU Savaii with a prevalence of 0.46% and EU Apia Urban Area and Rest of Upolu with a prevalence of 0.08% indicate interrupted LF transmission in these regions.  On the other hand, North West Upolu region which had been indicated in past prevalence surveys to be a problem area showed a prevalence rate of 1.49%.  As such, Samoa needs to consider conducting 2 more rounds of MDAs in the North West Upolu region and repeating the Transmission Assessment Survey after 2-3 years in Savaii and Apia Urban Area and Rest of Upolu to establish recrudescence. Simultaneously, Samoa needs to strengthen mosquito surveillance and control to address Lymphatic Filariasis as well as personal protection from mosquitoes.", "Year": "2013", "Authors": "Government of Samoa, National Disease Surveillance & International Health Regulations (IHR) Division", "Journal": "", "Publisher": "", "Volume_Issue": "", "Pages": "13", "View_at_Publisher": "", "Work_Location": "Samoa", "Access_Rights": "Contact PacELF at JCU", "Open status checking ": "", "Activity - key words": "", "Other keywords": "", "Language": "English", "Additional Information": "", "Directory": "Samoa", "PDF_file_name": "PacELF_3128 Government of Samoa Minisitry of Health NDSIHR Division 2013 Lymphatic Filariasis TAS 2013 Final Report 23 July 2013", "Working comments": "", "Work location issues": "", "Not Pacific and excluded from load for Phase 1": "", "Fixed_TXT_file_name": "PacELF_3128_Government_of_Samoa_Minisitry_of_Health_NDSIHR_Division_2013_Lymphatic_Filariasis_TAS_2013_Final_Report_23_July_2013", "download_url": "/statics/data/PacELF_3128_Government_of_Samoa_Minisitry_of_Health_NDSIHR_Division_2013_Lymphatic_Filariasis_TAS_2013_Final_Report_23_July_2013"}, {"ID": "3130", "Source Collection": "JCU", "SiteNum": "", "HardcopyLocation2020": "JCU WHOCC", "LocationDetail": "", "Type": "Electronic", "Flag Duplicate": "", "Keep or Drop?": "", "ID_dup": "", "Category": "Meeting Reports", "Title": "Binational planning between American Samoa and Samoa to accelerate elimination of lymphatic filariasis, 2017.
