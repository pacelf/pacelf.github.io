            <h5>The PacELF Endgame Project and Digital Library</h5>
            <p>
              Our goal is to assist in achieving and documenting the elimination of lymphatic filariasis in the
              Pacific Region. We contribute to this by collating, synthesizing, and disseminating information on filariasis
              in the Pacific, in published or unpublished papers and reports, with a focus on the PacELF period from 1999 up to the end of 2020.
              The digital archive is supplemented by our collection of hard copy documents including the personal collection of
              Dr Kazuyo Ichimori, housed at James Cook University's Bebegu Yumba Campus in the JCU
              <a href="https://www.jcu.edu.au/whocc-for-vector-borne-and-neglected-tropical-diseases" target="_blank">

              <a href="mailto:pacelf@jcu.edu.au">pacelf@jcu.edu.au</a> or by visiting in person. We scan hardcopy documents on request.

            <p>
              We have many uncatalogued documents in addition to the ones currently shown in the online Library.
              Reach out to <a href="mailto:pacelf@jcu.edu.au" target="_blank">pacelf@jcu.edu.au</a> if you
              wish to visit the archive in Townsville or would
              like help finding additional materials for a particular project. We appreciate hearing about projects
              for which library materials have been used.

            We are very grateful to Dr Ichimori and James Cook University's WHOCC, eResearch Centre, and Library for
