Patients/Method: We developed three main types of scotomectomy-plasty: unilateral, bilateral and resection of the inferior pole, utilized in a series of 50 scrotomectomy-plasty in a homogeneous series of 148 hydrocelectomy in 117 patients. Results: 92% of patients treated by scrotomectomy-plasty had a hydrocele at an advanced stage (54% stage III and 38% stage IV). In 24% of preoperative indications for scrotomectomy-plasty we observed during surgery a sufficient retraction of the scrotum to prevent it. Thus, out of 1 17 patients 43% had a scrotomectomy-plasty. We recorded 6 complications, all in hydroceles stages III or IV with scrotomectomy-plasty. Five of these patients had a hematocele or chylocele. Two did not benefit from our compressive dressing. These complications only delayed by a few days the complete cure. In all cases the esthetic result was very satisfactory. Conclusion: The esthetic and functional result of hydrocelectomy is significantly completed through resectionplasty of the scrotum without increasing the postoperative morbidity in the immediate and close follow up. The three main types of scrotomectomy-plasty that we developed and utilized allowed us to properly manage all stages from I to IV of our clinical classification.The technique should be extended to other homogeneous series for a more precise codification of the procedures as outlined and a review of patients on distant follow up.',Year:"2013",Authors:"Capuano, G.P., Capuano, C.",Journal:"Fiji Journal of Public Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"2(2)",Pages:"18-25","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"78",Category:"Proposals",Title:"LF Hydroceles project in Fiji: A unique approach looking for financial support to fully complete and document an already-successful project",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2015",Authors:"Capuano, G.P.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"6","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"91",Category:"Action/Strategic Plans",Title:"Communication-for-behavioural impact (COMBI) plan for lymphatic filariasis mass drug administration in the Fiji Islands",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2008",Authors:"Odugleh-Kolev, A.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"Ministry of Health Fiji; WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"24","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"92",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"Lymphatic Filariasis Hydrocelectomy Project, Fiji",Description:"This consists of phase 3 of the project",Year:"2011",Authors:"Capuano, G.P.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"Ministry of Health Fiji","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"11","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"93",Category:"Guidelines and Instructional Materials",Title:"Preparation of MF slide (Three line method)",Description:"Standard operation procedure of how to prepare an MF slide (three line method)",Year:"2007",Authors:"PacELF",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"1","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_93_Annex_2_blood_smear_protocol.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"94",Category:"Guidelines and Instructional Materials",Title:"How to use ICT",Description:"Standard operation procedure on how to use ICT",Year:"2007",Authors:"PacELF",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"2","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_94_Annex_2_How_to_use_ICT_working_instruction.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"95",Category:"Forms",Title:"Re-application for continuation or expansion of Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2012",Authors:"Kama, M.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"21","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"101",Category:"Forms",Title:"Receiving report",Description:"Document includes a receipt of the Government of French Polynesia receiving Albendazole",Year:"2010",Authors:"Lot, S.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"1","Work Location":["French Polynesia"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"105",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Histoire de la lutte contre la filariose lymphatique en Polyn\xE9sie fran\xE7aise: Le\xE7ons de 50 ann\xE9es d'efforts [The history of lymphatic filariasis control programme in French Polynesia: Lessons from a 50 years effort]",Description:"With a mean prevalence of microfilariaemia superior to 15% in the four archipelagos of the territory, French Polynesia was confronted with a huge public health problem of Wuchereria bancrofti - associated filarias during the 50s. Supported by a strong US sponsoring, a large scale control campaign based on diethylcarbamazine (DEC) distribution was launched and led to the method of spaced doses (the most useful protocol being one annual DEC dose). Progressively applied to the whole Polynesian population since 1974, this very innovative programme had generated the idea of a pos-sible eradication of the parasitosis. Meanwhile at laboratory level important progress in Immunology (mainly the validation of rapid diagnosis tests detecting a specific antigenemia) and later in Molecular Biology (with the main application being the follow-up of the infection status of the vector Aedes polynesiensis) questioned this optimistic concept (one lesson given by the study of Maupiti island, considered as a 0% reference island for a long time). More recently a regional WHO-sponsorized control programme, called PacELF, has for main objective the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in the South Pacific region near 2010. This objective argues for using a (DEC and albendazole) drug combination cumulating micro- and macro-filaricid activities.

A statistical model of the extrinsic cycle duration as a function of temperature is described and used to distinguish three patterns of W. bancrofti transmission dynamics: continuous, fluctuating and discontinuous, occurring from north to south geographically among French Polynesian archipelagos. In the northerly Marquesas Islands (8-11 degrees S) filariasis transmission is continuous and very active, facilitated by perennially high temperatures combined with constantly high rates of man-vector contact. In the southerly Australes Islands (21-28 degrees S) filariasis transmission is seasonally discontinuous and, during the cooler months (May-September), the model predicts virtually no transmission because the cycle duration exceeds the life expectancy of the vector. In the Society Islands (16-18 degrees S), between the Marquesas and Australes, transmission is predicted to be intermediate as expected from their latitude, with seasonally fluctuating transmission potential. In the Tuamotu Islands (also geographically intermediate: 14-23 degrees S), with theoretically perennial transmission potential, transmission occurs only intermittently, being limited by other human and environmental factors whereby man-vector contact is confined to seasonal agricultural situations. Generally, among French Polynesian archipelagos where Aedes polynesiensis is the vector, the transmission potential for W. bancrofti and resulting disease manifestations of lymphatic filariasis in humans are correlated with ambient temperature due to the degree of southern latitude.",Year:"2001",Authors:"Lardeux, F., Cheffort, J.",Journal:"Medical and Veterinary Entomology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"15(2)",Pages:"167-176","Work Location":["French Polynesia"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"109",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Control of the Aedes vectors of the dengue viruses and Wuchereria bancrofti: the French Polynesian experience",Description:"In most of the 130 islands of French Polynesia, the stenotopic mosquitoes Aedes aegypti (the main local vector for the viruses causing dengue) and Aedes polynesiensis (the main local vector of Wuchereria bancrofti) share many breeding sites in water containers such as discarded cans, coconut shells, buckets and water-storage pots and drums. In addition to selective application of insecticides, non-polluting methods of controlling these mosquitoes have been evaluated during the last decade in two main ecological situations: (1) villages, where Aedes breeding sites are typically peridomestic; and (2) flooded burrows of land crabs, the major source of Ae. polynesiensis throughout the South Pacific region. Large-scale trials of biological control agents, such as mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis and Poecilia reticulata) and copepods (Mesocyclops aspericornis), and of integrated-control strategies have demonstrated the efficacy of certain techniques and control agents against the target Aedes populations in some village situations. Generally, mechanical methods (the use of layers of polystyrene beads against mosquito larvae and pupae, and screening against adult mosquitoes) were more efficient than use of the biological control agents. By integrating several methods of control, mosquito densities (as measured by human-bait collections and larval surveys) were reduced significantly compared with the results of concurrent sampling from untreated villages, and control remained effective for months after the interventions ceased. In land-crab burrows, the first attempts to control Aedes larvae used bacterial agents (Bacillus thuringiensis) and predatory copepods gave disappointing results. Mesocyclops aspericornis could be an effective control agent if the burrows were constantly flooded, but most burrows dry out and refill periodically, so copepod populations do not survive. As it proved difficult to reach all corners of the long sinuous burrows with any control agent, larvicidal (chlorpyrifos-methyl) baits were developed for foraging crabs to carry into their burrows. This novel technique proved to be effective and could become the method of choice for treating crab burrows. Further research is underway to find the optimum (biological or chemical) larvicidal ingredient for the crab bait. Despite the ecological and logistical challenges of controlling the Aedes vectors of the dengue viruses and W. bancrofti in so many scattered islands, the French Polynesian experience indicates that relatively simple methods can be integrated and applied effectively and economically. Operationally, however, success also depends on a strong political commitment and on at-risk communities that are sufficiently motivated to maintain a good level of Aedes

The meeting was attended by temporary advisors from the Pacific, international experts and the WHO. The TWG meeting followed on from recommendations made in 2007 to conduct technically strong surveys in a number of countries.

Final version 7 jul 2007",Description:`This surveillance strategy is designed to be in effect until all PICTs reach the target of \u201CNo ongoing transmission of LF\u201D. It is hoped that this can be achieved within five years of stopping Mass Drug Administration (MDA), i.e. by 2012 for the first PICTs and by 2017 for most of the other endemic PICTs. It is acknowledged that Papua New Guinea will require a modification of this strategy due to its larger population; this should be developed as PNG nears completion of MDA.
In 2004, the WHO Pacific Program to Eliminate LF defined interruption of transmission as <0.1% of 5-year-olds being ICT positive by D survey. Interruption of transmission is extremely important, as it shows that the MDAs have been successful. However, it is the ONGOING absence of transmission that is required to prove elimination.
The LF Surveillance Strategy provides a means of demonstrating that transmission has stopped permanently within a population. It requires countries to look for transmission of LF with more rigor than previously. This is necessary, as the disease has become less prevalent. In addition, this strategy provides a mechanism of detecting and eliminating small foci of infection within a country, with an intentionally intensive follow-up of positive cases.
The strategy uses a Primary surveillance strategy, called the Child Transmission Survey (CTS). This is a modification of the previous D Survey. The endpoint marker remains the same, that is, evidence of interruption of transmission has occurred once <0.1% of children are ICT positive. Built into this new strategy is a mechanism of detecting and eliminating the source of transmission within the community, termed \u201CClose Contact Testing\u201D. In addition, the recommended surveillance algorithms require repeated confirmation that transmission has been interrupted, over several years, so that a country can be sure that transmission has stopped permanently. It is anticipated that all countries will participate in this Primary surveillance strategy.
In order to augment the Child Transmission Survey, a \u201CHot Spot\u201D Survey, which looks more closely for transmission in areas of previously high prevalence is recommended, for countries that are able to identify such an area.
In addition, a secondary surveillance strategy, called Border Detection, is proposed for consideration as a trial in some countries. It is recommended that some countries participate in Border Detection, which aims to detect potential sources of reintroduction of infection from outside the country.`,Year:"2007",Authors:"Huppatz, C., Durrheim, D., Capuano, C., Lammie, P., Melrose, W., Ottesen, E., Kelly, P.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"56","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_233_MissionReport-Huppatz-Fiji-LF_Surveillance_Strategy.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"251",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"STAG-NTD M&E sub-working group on disease specific indicators Re-assessment of status of 9 LF-endemic countries that did not require MDA",Description:"Meeting held in Atlanta 23 March 2011 to review status including in 9 coutnries that did not require MDA: Burkina Faso; Togo; Burundi, Cape Verde, Seychelles, Rwanda, Mauritius, Solomon Islands, Costa Rica, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago.

This program is progressing well in many countries. However, progress has been slow in some countries, and others have not yet started their mass drug administration (MDA) programs. Acceleration is needed. We studied how increasing MDA frequency from once to twice per year would affect program duration and costs by using computer simulation modeling and cost projections. We used the LYMFASIM simulation model to estimate how many annual or semiannual MDA rounds would be required to eliminate LF for Indian and West African scenarios with varied pre-control endemicity and coverage levels. Results were used to estimate total program costs assuming a target population of 100,000 eligibles, a 3% discount rate, and not counting the costs of donated drugs. A sensitivity analysis was done to investigate the robustness of these results with varied assumptions for key parameters. Model predictions suggested that semiannual MDA will require the same number of MDA rounds to achieve LF elimination as annual MDA in most scenarios. Thus semiannual MDA programs should achieve this goal in half of the time required for annual programs. Due to efficiency gains, total program costs for semiannual MDA programs are projected to be lower than those for annual MDA programs in most scenarios. A sensitivity analysis showed that this conclusion is robust. Semiannual MDA is likely to shorten the time and lower the cost required for LF elimination in countries where it can be implemented.

However, long-term use of antibiotics may contribute to drug resistance and are not practical for use in remote areas.

Presently used antifilarial drugs are able to strongly reduce transmission and will thus ultimately lower the burden of morbidity associated with the infection, however, a chemotherapeutic principle that directly induces a halt or improvement in the progression of the morbidity in already infected individuals would constitute a major lead. In search of such a more-effective drug to complement the existing ones, in an area endemic for bancroftian filariasis in Ghana, 33 microfilaremic and 18 lymphedema patients took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 6-wk regimen of 200 mg/day doxycycline. Four months after doxycycline treatment, all patients received 150-200 lg/kg ivermectin and 400 mg albendazole. Patients were monitored for Wolbachia and microfilaria loads, antigenemia, filarial dance sign (FDS), dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels, and plasma levels of lymphangiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor-C [VEGF-C] and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 [(s)VEGFR-3]). Lymphedema patients were additionally monitored for stage (grade) of lymphedema and the circumferences of affected legs. Wolbachia load, microfilaremia, antigenemia, and frequency of FDS were significantly reduced in microfilaremic patients up to 24 mo in the doxycycline group compared to the placebo group. The mean dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels in doxycycline-treated patients was reduced significantly at 24 mo, whereas there was no improvement in the placebo group. Preceding clinical improvement, at 12 mo, the mean plasma levels of VEGF-C and sVEGFR-3 decreased significantly in the doxycycline-treated patients to a level close to that of endemic normal values, whereas there was no significant reduction in the placebo patients. The extent of disease in lymphedema patients significantly improved following doxycycline, with the mean stage of lymphedema in the doxycycline-treated patients being significantly lower compared to placebo patients 12 mo after treatment. The reduction in the stages manifested as better skin texture, a reduction of deep folds, and fewer deep skin folds. In conclusion, a 6-wk regimen of antifilarial treatment with doxycycline against W. bancrofti showed a strong macrofilaricidal activity and reduction in plasma levels of VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3, the latter being associated with amelioration of supratesticular dilated lymphatic vessels and with an improvement of pathology in lymphatic filariasis patients.",Year:"2006",Authors:"Debrah, A.Y., Mand, S., Specht, S., Marfo-Debrekyei, Y., Batsa, L., Pfarr, K., Larbi, J., Lawson, B., Taylor, M., Adjei, O., Hoerauf, A.",Journal:"PLoS Pathogens",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"2(9)",Pages:"829-843","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_317_Debrah_et_al_2006_PLOS_PATHOGENS_Doxycycline_reduces_VGF_and_improves_pathology_LF.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"319",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Assessing Progress in Reducing the At-Risk Population after 13 Years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis",Description:"In 1997, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution 50.29, committing to the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem, subsequently targeted for 2020.

In 1998 Baseline survey by the Vanuatu Ministry of Health has indicate 2.48% of people surveyed had microfilaria in their blood and 4.79% antigen positives.	The parasite is Wuchereria bancrofti with nocturnal periodicity and the vector is Anopheles farauti.
In 1998 Vanuatu established it National Filariasis Elimination program with two aims of eliminating filariasis in Vanuatu and eliminate the risk of infection by 2004. Mass Drug Administration (MDA) of albendazole and DEC was carried out in 2000 to 2004 and the treatment coverage was above 80% for five consecutive years and at the same time strengthening our distribution of mosquito net to the communities. In 2003 Mid-Term evaluation reveal 93% dropped of antigenamea prevalence and 63% dropped of microfilaria prevalence (7.88%, 0.77%) from the baseline survey.  In 2005 survey after the 5th round of MDA has revealed zero percent of mf and antigenaemia prevalence dropped to 0.17%.
This survey has been divided into 3 category: 1) Child Transmission survey testing children that was born a year after the first MDA (6 years old only) 2) Hot Spot survey testing children 3-6 years old due to higher prevalence from the previous survey 3) Communities Survey testing the whole communities within the hot spot area due to the higher prevalence from the opportunity test (LF blood test that was integrated with other activities like net distribution and any other work that was conducted at that particular area and time) and lack of information and surveyed were carried out in this area and also due to antigen-antibody result from JCU.
The objectives of this survey is to confirm the interruption of transmission of LF after the 5 years treatment, to assess the prevalence of LF antigenaemia among children that was born after  the first MDA, to assess LF prevalence in the hot spot area among children 3-6 years old, to update LF patients record with nurses and map out, to conduct training on home care bases with family members of the LF patients and nurses in that area and lastly to assess mosquito net coverage and usage among the communities as vector control measure.`,Year:"2007",Authors:"Vanuatu Ministry of Health",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"19","Work Location":["Vanuatu"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"377",Category:"Dossiers",Title:"Verification of elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in Vanuatu Summary",Description:"This dossier explains the protocols used in Vanuatu to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.",Year:"2013",Authors:"Dardick, E.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"3","Work Location":["Vanuatu"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"394",Category:"Proposals",Title:"Assessment of Lymphatic Filariasis Transmission and Hepatitis B Prevalence among Primary School Children in Wallis and Futuna protocol",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2012",Authors:"Mathelin, JP.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"24","Work Location":["Wallis and Futuna"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"395",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Assessment of lymphatic filariasis transmission and hepatitis B prevalence and vaccination coverage among children in primary schools in Wallis and Futuna, November 2012",Description:`The French overseas territory of the Wallis and Futuna Islands (WAF) in the South Pacific, conducted a combined survey in elementary school children to determine whether transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF) has ceased and to assess Hepatitis B (HB) prevalence.
The survey targeted all 1,014 primary school students of 13 elementary schools in WAF. Children of all five grades were tested for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) and only 4th and 5th grade students for HB virus surface antigen (HBsAg). We tested whether LF antigenaemia prevalence was lower than 1% (i.e. the number of positives should have not exceeded the first integer below 0.01 times the number of children tested) and calculated HBsAg prevalence. We also calculated the coverage of the three doses of HB vaccine in general and also according to the appropriate age based on two different schedules: the one enforced between 1992 and 2005 (the time when the surveyed children were born) and the current one (in place since 2006), always considering a minimum interval of at least 28 days between doses.
Out of 950 children surveyed for LF, 482 (50.7%) were male and 468 (49.3%) female. Their age ranged from 6.8 up to 12.9 years (mean: 9.5). The result was negative for 932 children, invalid for four, while 11 children refused to participate. Three children were found to be LF antigen positive. This was below the critical cut-off of nine cases (i.e. first integer <0.01x935). The positive cases were a seven-year-old girl resident in Futuna, and a ten-year-old girl and a eight-year-old boy, both residents in Wallis. Hence, LF prevalence was 0.32% (3/935) in WAF; 0.33% (2/604) in Wallis; and 0.30% (1/331) in Futuna. Five children were found HBsAg positive (Table 2) and 456 negative; eight refused to participate. Overall this resulted in a proportion of positivity of 1.08% (5/461). However, 35 students (including one positive) were attending second and third grade and were excluded from the analysis, as per protocol. Of the remaining 434, six refused to participate and were also excluded. Further analysis was performed on the remaining 428 children. Their age ranged from eight to 12 years (mean: 10.5) and 235 (55%) were male. Hence, HBsAg prevalence in the fourth and fifth grade cohort was 0.93% (4/428) in WAF; 1.12% (3/267) in Wallis; and 0.62 (1/161) in Futuna. Coverage for the three doses of HB vaccination was 97% for the first two doses and 96 for the third one. Timely coverage was lower, with respectively 80, 56, and 65% of children vaccinated with the three doses according to the schedule in place in 1992-2005, when the surveyed children were born; and 49% of children receiving all three doses before one year of age.
WAF probably reached the goal of LF elimination (<1%) and at least the 2012 interim goal for HB control (<2%), if not the final one (<1%). HB vaccination coverage was high, but many children were vaccinated late compared to the schedule in place at the time (1992-2005). It is now recommended to continue post mass drug administration surveillance for the next five years to ensure that LF has been eliminated as a public health problem, and to increase HB vaccination efforts, especially regarding timeliness of vaccination. Combining HB and LF in the survey was useful for evidence-based decision-making in a remote and resource-limited setting.`,Year:"2012",Authors:"Mathelin, JP., Pezzoli, L., Hennessey, K., Aratchige, P., Valiakolleri, J., Kim, S.H.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"20","Work Location":["Wallis and Futuna"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"406",Category:"Books",Title:"PacELF Data Book 2006",Description:"This book summarises all the data gathered the progress of the program towards the elimination of lymphatic filariasis, for every country involved in the PacELF group, to 2006.

The pre-experimental microfilarial infection rate and mean density in 20 c.mm. were 12.2 per cent. and 4.05. The follow-up (4th) survey included 1430 people.

It is concluded that disease transmission on a significant scale is unlikely to have resumed yet. When known positive cases are considered alone, the proportion not cured by treatment with two courses of drugs appears to have risen from 7 per cent. to 35 per cent. in the 4 years since treatment. It is known, however, that about 40 per cent. of those apparently cured were still harbouring microfilariae in numbers too small for detection by the routine method used, and there has not been any significant increase in the true infection rate. The records of individual subjects show that some had become positive but these were balanced by others who had become negative. The mean mf.d. had, however, increased about 30 times.

LF is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and there are more than 119 million people infected (Michael et al. 1996). In 1997, WHO launched the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, which aims to eliminate LF from 80 countries in which it is endemic, by the year 2020.

Herein, we present data evaluating the interaction between Wuchereria bancrofti and Anopheles punctulatus in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Our field studies in PNG demonstrated that An. punctulatus utilizes the melanization immune response as a natural mechanism of filarial worm resistance against invading W. bancrofti microfilariae. We then conducted laboratory studies utilizing the mosquitoes Armigeres subalbatus and Aedes aegypti and the parasites Brugia malayi, Brugia pahangi, Dirofilaria immitis, and Plasmodium gallinaceum to evaluate the hypothesis that immune activation and/or development by filarial worms negatively impact Plasmodium development in co-infected mosquitoes. Ar. subalbatus used in this study are natural vectors of P. gallinaceum and B. pahangi and they are naturally refractory to B. malayi (melanization-based refractoriness). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mosquitoes were dissected and Plasmodium development was analyzed six days after blood feeding on either P. gallinaceum alone or after taking a bloodmeal containing both P. gallinaceum and B. malayi or a bloodmeal containing both P. gallinaceum and B. pahangi. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence and mean intensity of Plasmodium infections in two species of mosquito that had dual infections as compared to those mosquitoes that were infected with Plasmodium alone, and was independent of whether the mosquito had a melanization immune response to the filarial worm or not. However, there was no reduction in Plasmodium development when filarial worms were present in the bloodmeal (D. immitis) but midgut penetration was absent, suggesting that factors associated with penetration of the midgut by filarial worms likely are responsible for the observed reduction in malaria parasite infections.

Here we examine an artificially infected strain of Aedes polynesiensis, the primary vector of Wuchereria bancrofti, which is the causative agent of Lymphatic filariasis (LF) throughout much of the South Pacific. Embryonic microinjection was used to transfer the wAlbB infection from Aedes albopictus into an aposymbiotic strain of Ae. polynesiensis. The resulting strain (designated "MTB") experiences a stable artificial infection with high maternal inheritance. Reciprocal crosses of MTB with naturally infected wild-type Ae. polynesiensis demonstrate strong bidirectional incompatibility. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the MTB strain differ significantly relative to that of the wild-type, indicating an impaired ability to regulate oxidative stress. Following a challenge with Brugia pahangi, the number of filarial worms achieving the infective stage is significantly reduced in MTB as compared to the naturally infected and aposymbiotic strains. Survivorship of MTB differed significantly from that of the wild-type, with an interactive effect between survivorship and blood feeding. The results demonstrate a direct correlation between decreased ROS levels and decreased survival of adult female Aedes polynesiensis. The results are discussed in relation to the interaction of Wolbachia with ROS production and antioxidant expression, iron homeostasis and the insect immune system.

Major medical problems include malaria and bancroftian filariasis. An entomological survey conducted along an altitudinal transect from 170 to 1000m identified Anopheles koliensis as the predominant malaria vector below 650 m, with A. punctulatus dominating at the higher elevations. Proportions of mosquitoes with malaria circumsporozoite antigens diminished with increasing altitude, as did the proportion of mosquitoes infected with stage 3 larvae of Wuchereria bancrofti. These patterns are consistent with increases in the length of the extrinsic incubation period associated with the lower temperatures found at higher altitudes. Inoculation rates varied less regularly with altitude, owing to local variation in biting rates, but were sufficient even at the higher elevations to maintain a high parasite prevalence in the human population.

From 1984 to 1998 surveys were carried out in northern Australia, Papua New Guinea and on islands in the southwest Pacific to determine the distribution of the A. punctulatus group. The results of these surveys have now been completed and have generated distribution data from more than 1500 localities through this region. Within this region several climatic and geographical barriers were identified that restricted species distribution and gene flow between geographic populations. This information was further assessed in light of a molecular phylogeny derived from the ssrDNA (18S). Subsequently, hypotheses have been generated on the evolution and distribution of the group so that future field and laboratory studies may be approached more systematically. This study suggested that the ability for widespread dispersal was found to have appeared independently in species that show niche-specific habitat preference (Anopheles farauti s.s. and A. punctulatus) and conversely in species that showed diversity in their larval habitat (Anopheles farauti 2). Adaptation to the monsoonal climate of northern Australia and southwest Papua New Guinea was found to have appeared independently in A. farauti s.s., A. farauti 2 and Anopheles farauti 3.

Species' distributions are now well established across Papua New Guinea, northern Australia, and the Solomon Archipelago, but little has been documented thus far in eastern Indonesia. As each species reveals significant differences in distribution and biology, the relative paucity of knowledge of their biology or ecology in relation to malaria transmission is brought into clearer focus. Only three of the species have undergone some form of spatial or population genetics analyses, and this has revealed striking differences in their genetic signatures throughout the region.

The biting habit of sporozoite-infected A. punctulatus was also investigated. The sporozoite rates for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were 1.8 and 1.4% respectively, but only one (1.3%) of 76 females infected with P. falciparum was caught between 18:00 and 21:00. A significantly higher proportion (11.6%) of mosquitoes infected with P. vivax was caught in the same period. The late biting habit of mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum is discussed in relation to the differential biting habits of parous and nulliparous females. We conclude with a hypothesis that, in areas where Anopheles mosquitoes have a late-biting cycle and low parous rate, exposure to mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum during the pre-bedtime period (18:00-22:00) is very low. This hypothesis could explain why insecticide-treated bed nets protect children better in areas of seasonal transmission, where nulliparous females tend to predominate, than in areas of perennial transmission, where parous females are usually more numerous.

This contribution describes the epidemiology and ecological features of filariasis and prospects for its elimination in Papua New Guinea. The frequencies of microfilaremia, chronic lymphatic disease, and acute filarial morbidity in Papua New Guinea are higher than in many other endemic countries of the Pacific, Africa, and South America. All possible combinations of these three manifestations of filariasis exist. They occur independently of each other, and there is no association between chronic lymphatic disease and microfilarial status. Anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes are the main vectors throughout the country. Transmission intensity is heterogeneous and a major determinant of local patent infection and morbidity rates. Annual transmission potential and annual infective biting rates are positively associated with the village-specific microfilarial rate, mean intensity of microfilaremia, and prevalence of leg edema. Children and adults have similar worm burdens, assessed by circulating filarial antigen levels, in areas of high transmission, whereas worm burdens increase with age in areas of lower transmission. Intensity of exposure to infective third-stage larvae (L3) is significantly correlated with filarial antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production, possibly by a mechanism that alters APC function. Historical evidence suggests that residual insecticide spraying conducted for malaria control in some parts of the country interrupted transmission of W. bancrofti as it did in the Solomon Islands. Prospects for eliminating lymphatic filariasis in Papua New Guinea are good and may be achieved by the end of the second decade of the twenty-first century if an integrated control approach using mass drug administration with vector control is adopted.",Year:"2003",Authors:"Bockarie, M.J., Kazura, J.W.",Journal:"Medical Microbiology and Immunology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"192(1)",Pages:"9-14","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"480",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Preventive chemotherapy as a strategy for elimination of neglected tropical parasitic diseases: endgame challenges",Description:"Global efforts to address neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) were stimulated in January 2012 by the London declaration at which 22 partners, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO) and major pharmaceutical companies committed to sustaining and expanding NTD programmes to eliminate or eradicate 11 NTDs by 2020 to achieve the goals outlined in the recently published WHO road map.

Of 53 studies from Africa, South East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and The Americas, 43 showed a lower mean prevalence of infection in females than in males. Prevalence is consistently lower in women of reproductive age and this is statistically significant in 16 of 32 studies classified by age and sex. Density of infection is also lower in the reproductive age but may be higher in children and in older women. Clinical disease is also lower in women and pathology has a later age of onset and rise to peak prevalence than in males. The paper assesses the evidence that lower rates of infection and clinical pathology are due to less exposure of females to infective vectors. It seems unlikely that exposure alone could account for these differences which are observed for both bancroftian and brugian filariasis, irrespective of periodicity. Several investigators have suggested that females have increased resistance to infection and this is supported by serological studies showing high antibody positivity to adult worm antigens in females. The review concludes that the association with the reproductive years suggests a pregnancy-associated mechanism.

In this study, we examined for an effect of Wolbachia on survivorship, developmental time, sex ratio, longevity, fecundity, and egg hatch of Aedes polynesiensis Marks, which is the primary vector of Wuchereria bancrofti in the South Pacific. In this study, we have compared strains of A. polynesiensis that are naturally and artificially infected with Wolbachia and additional strains that are aposymbiotic (Wolbachia removed to generate an uninfected strain).

An improved understanding of the mosquito population genetics is needed for insight into the population dynamics and dispersal, which can aid in understanding the epidemiology of disease transmission and control of the vector. In light of the potential release of a Wolbachia infected strain for vector control, our objectives were to investigate the microgeographical and temporal population genetic structure of A. polynesiensis within the Society Islands of French Polynesia, and to compare the genetic background of a laboratory strain intended for release into its population of origin. METHODS: A panel of eight microsatellite loci were used to genotype A. polynesiensis samples collected in French Polynesia from 2005-2008 and introgressed A. polynesiensis and Aedes riversi laboratory strains. Examination of genetic differentiation was performed using F-statistics, STRUCTURE, and an AMOVA. BAYESASS was used to estimate direction and rates of mosquito movement. RESULTS: FST values, AMOVA, and STRUCTURE analyses suggest low levels of intra-island differentiation from multiple collection sites on Tahiti, Raiatea, and Maupiti. Significant pair-wise FST values translate to relatively minor levels of inter-island genetic differentiation between more isolated islands and little differentiation between islands with greater commercial traffic (i.e., Tahiti, Raiatea, and Moorea). STRUCTURE analyses also indicate two population groups across the Society Islands, and the genetic makeup of Wolbachia infected strains intended for release is similar to that of wild-type populations from its island of origin, and unlike that of A. riversi. CONCLUSIONS: The observed panmictic population on Tahiti, Raiatea, and Moorea is consistent with hypothesized gene flow occurring between islands that have relatively high levels of air and maritime traffic, compared to that of the more isolated Maupiti and Tahaa.

As part of current global campaign, mass drug administration (MDA) has effectively reduced lymphatic filiariasis prevalence, but mosquito vector biology can complicate the MDA strategy. In some regions, there is evidence that the goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone. Obligate vector mosquitoes provide additional targets for breaking the LF transmission cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector throughout much of the South Pacific, Aedes polynesiensis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in an A. polynesiensis strain ('CP' strain) that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays demonstrate that CP males are equally competitive, resulting in population elimination when CP males are introduced into wild type A. polynesiensis populations.

While doses as low as 20 mug/kg could effect transient microfilarial (mf) clearance, higher dosages induced greater and more sustained mf reduction. The single dose of 400 mug/kg yieldcd maximal responses, but a number of practical considerations suggest that either 400 mug/kg or 200 mug/kg doses would be acceptable for use in LF control programmes.

This is largely due to the difficulty of finding an adequate and unbiased sample of resting, engorged mosquitoes to enable the identification of host blood meal sources. This is particularly difficult in the south-west Pacific countries of Indonesia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea where thick vegetation constitutes the primary resting sites for the exophilic mosquitoes that are the primary malaria and filariasis vectors. METHODS: Barrier screens of shade-cloth netting attached to bamboo poles were constructed between villages and likely areas where mosquitoes might seek blood meals or rest. Flying mosquitoes, obstructed by the barrier screens, would temporarily stop and could then be captured by aspiration at hourly intervals throughout the night. RESULTS: In the three countries where this method was evaluated, blood-fed females of Anopheles farauti, Anopheles bancroftii, Anopheles longirostris, Anopheles sundaicus, Anopheles vagus, Anopheles kochi, Anopheles annularis, Anopheles tessellatus, Culex vishnui, Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia spp were collected while resting on the barrier screens.

The impact of untreated bednets on the prevalence of Wuchereria bancrofti (Cobbold) (Nematoda: Filarioidea) infection and disease was investigated on Bagabag island in Papua New Guinea, where both malaria and filariasis are transmitted by the same vector mosquitoes of the Anopheles punctulatus D\xF6nitz group (Diptera: Culicidae). Community-wide surveys were conducted recording demographic characteristics including bednet usage. Physical examinations for hydrocoele and lymphoedema were performed and blood samples assessed for filarial and malaria parasites. Mosquitoes were sampled using the all-night landing catch method and individually dissected to determine W. bancrofti infection and infective rates. Bednet usage among residents was 61% and the mean age of users (25.6 years) was similar to non-users (22.5 years).

Microfilarial (mf) density and serum levels of W. bancrofti phosphorylcholine-containing antigen (PC-Ag) in individuals were used as indirect measures of adult worm burden. These parasitological data were collected from 126 subjects > 4 years of age at two time points, 12 months apart, prior to the administration of the antifilarial drug diethylcarbamazine (DEC). No significant changes in levels of mf density were observed for the study population between these two time points. However, significant changes in the levels of circulating PC-Ag were noted in subjects \u2264 20 years of age, but not in subjects > 20 years of age, between these two time points. The apparent shorter half life of circulating PC-Ag compared to that of mf makes antigenemia a more sensitive measure of the dynamics of adult worm populations. These data are discussed in terms of a basic mathematical model describing the dynamics of adult worm populations in relation to their life expectancy and attrition of larvae during establishment.

The number of hydroceles treated was 83. We developed and evaluated a much needed clinical classification of hydroceles based on four criteria: Type (uni/bilateral); Side (left/right); Stage of enlargement of the scrotum rated from I to VI; Grade of burial of the penis rated from 0 to 4. It lead to the conclusion that 1) A Stage I or II hydrocele, associated with Grade 0 or 1 penis burial could be considered a "Simple Hydrocele". The surgical treatment is simple with no anticipated early complication. WHO Level II of health care structure seems adapted. 2) A Stage III or IV hydrocele associated with Grade 2, 3 or 4 penis burial could be considered a "Complicated Hydrocele". The operation is longer, more complicated and the possibility of occurrence of complications seems greater. A level III health care facility would be more adapted under the normal functioning of the health system. We conclude that a standardized clinical classification of hydroceles based on the Stage of enlargement of the scrotum and the Grade of burial of the penis appears to be a useful tool to guide the decision about the level of care and the surgical technique required. We use the same classification for penoscrotal lymphoedema. A decision tree is presented for the management of hydroceles in lymphatic filariasis endemic countries which could usefully complement the "Algorithm for management of scrotal swelling" proposed by WHO in 2002.

Twelve months after the second treatment, in carriers who were given a dose greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/kg, mean mf density was 4-7% of the initial pretreatment mf density. Therefore, several successive annual treatments with single doses greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/kg of ivermectin should result in reducing mf densities to a very low level. Nevertheless, at 9 months after the second treatment, residual parasitaemia ranged from 1 to 2182 mf/ml (median 85) in 30 patients. Finally, in patients with pretreatment mf counts less than or equal to 150 mf/ml, mean mf density was 2.8 and 8.9 mf/ml, respectively, during the 2 six-month periods following treatment, while in patients with pretreatment mf densities greater than 150 mf/ml (median 1500) it was 92.3 and 334.1 mf/ml during the same periods.

Despite decades of ongoing mass drug administration (MDA) in the region, some island nations have not yet achieved the threshold levels of microfilaremia established by the World Health Organization for eliminating transmission. Previously, the generation of a novel Aedes polynesiensis strain (CP) infected with an exogenous type of Wolbachia has been described. The CP mosquito is cytoplasmically incompatible (i.e., effectively sterile) when mated with wildtype mosquitoes, and a strategy was proposed for the control of A. polynesiensis populations by repeated, inundative releases of CP males to disrupt fertility of wild females. Such a strategy could lead to suppression of the vector population and subsequently lead to a reduction in the transmission of filarial worms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CP males and F1 male offspring from wild-caught A. polynesiensis females exhibit near equal mating competitiveness with F1 females under semi-field conditions.

Infection dynamics are modeled using the well established immigration-death formulation, incorporating the acquisition of immunity to infective larvae over time. The dynamics of disease (lymphodema and hydrocele) are modeled as a catalytic function of a variety of factors, including worm load and the impact of immunopathological responses. The model was parameterized using age-stratified data collected from a Bancroftian filariasis endemic area in Pondicherry in southern India. The fitted parameters suggest that a relatively simple model including only acquired immunity to infection and irreversible progression to disease can satisfactorily explain the observed infection and disease patterns. Disease progression is assumed to be a consequence of worm induced damage and to occur at a high rate for hydrocele and a low rate for lymphodema. This suggests that immunopathology involvement may not be a necessary component of observed age-disease profiles.

Following the World Health Assembly resolution in 1997, the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched. In the Pacific, the World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented from 1999, the Pacific Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PacELF) bringing together the 22 countries and territories, in a common effort to eliminate the disease. The strategy is based on Mass Drug Administration (MDA); in annual single dose during 5 years of a Diethycarbamazine/Albendazole association distributed to all the population at risk. Among the 22 countries and territories of the Pacific, 16 are endemic and 6 are non endemic. The classification is based according to the filarian antigen prevalence upper or lower than 1%. MDA are decided when the rate of the filarian antigen prevalence is > 1%. The objective of PacELF is to reduce this rate down to < 1%, threshold under which the transmission is supposed to be stopped. From 1999 to 2007, 14 of the 16 endemic countries organized MDA. Eleven of them completed the cycle of 5 treatments and even beyond. But, these MDA reached only 19% of the at risk population, because of logistic difficulties in Papua New Guinea, the most populated country in the Pacific. The investigations carried out in sentinel sites showed a public health impact, by the fall of the number of microfilaria carriers, often down to a rate < 1%. However the rate of circulating antigen prevalence remains often above the required threshold of 1%. Prevalence surveys carried out in 2007, in different endemic countries, revealed the necessity to intensify efforts and to refine strategy for elimination of FL from the Pacific. A lot of progress were obtained, but few problems were identified. Reflexions are imperative and in progress about: the MDA coverage rates while at the same time a certain lassitude appears in the populations and among health staff, the methods to evaluate the effectiveness of MDA, the reliability of the diagnostic tools to decide of the stop of MDA and to certify the absence of the transmission, the relevance of univocal biological criteria for the whole Pacific area, the need for an active surveillance during several years after stopping MDA, particularly in the countries affected by the very efficient vector Aedes polynesiensis. Seven years after its launching, despite undeniable success, the PacELF program did not achieve its very ambitious goal of stopping the transmission. Three years before its term, strong efforts have to be done and additional strategies be implemented. However; it is reasonable to expect the prolongation of the program in order to achieve the final objective.

To identify the malaria vectors in PNG we studied Anopheles specimens from 232 collection localities around human habitation throughout PNG (using CO(2) baited light traps and human bait collections). A total of 22,970 mosquitoes were individually assessed using a Plasmodium sporozoite enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to identify Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae circumsporozoite proteins. All mosquitoes were identified to species by morphology and/or PCR. Based on distribution, abundance and their ability to develop sporozoites, we identified five species as major vectors of malaria in PNG. These included: Anopheles farauti, Anopheles hinesorum (incriminated here, to our knowledge, for the first time), Anopheles farauti 4, Anopheles koliensis and Anopheles punctulatus. Anopheles longirostris and Anopheles bancroftii were also incriminated in this study. Surprisingly, An. longirostris showed a high incidence of infections in some areas. A newly identified taxon within the Punctulatus Group, tentatively called An. farauti 8, was also found positive for circumsporozoite protein. These latter three species, together with Anopheles karwari and Anopheles subpictus, incriminated in other studies, appear to be only minor vectors, while Anopheles farauti 6 appears to be the major vector in the highland river valleys (>1500 m above sea level).

METHODS: Using variance-component analysis, we examined the contribution of shared genetic and environmental effects on host clinical and immune responses to filarial infection, along with potential confounding determinants. RESULTS: Sex was found to have a negligible influence on heritability estimates, but shared-household effects accounted for up to 32% of host variability. After accounting for these shared-household effects, heritability estimates suggested that levels of microfilariae and circulating adult worm antigen, as well as host eosinophil and immunoglobulin G antibody responses to larval and adult worm antigens, were highly heritable (range of heritability estimates, 0.15-0.84).

As the global prevalence of infection was not known in New Caledonia (NC), a serosurvey study was conducted by determining the prevalence of circulating filarial antigens, as recommended by the World Health Organization. FINDINGS: A cross sectional study on a 2 degree stratified sample was carried out from June to November 2013. Inclusion criteria were: individuals aged 2 to 80 y/o, who had been hospitalized or sought medical care for a non-infectious cause and who had been living in NC for more than 6 months. LF antigenic detection was performed using the immunocromatographic BinaxNOW filariasis card test (ICT). Among the 1,035 individuals tested, 7 were antigenic. The overall LF antigenic prevalence was 0.62% (CI 95% [0.60-0.63]). All patients were unrelated to each other; none of them presented clinical symptoms of LF. Four of the 7 ICT positive patients reported having travelled to LF endemic areas, 2 patients had never traveled outside NC and the last one had only traveled in non-endemic areas. For the 7 ICT positive patients, the research of microfilariae in blood smears and filarial DNA by PCR was negative. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of filarial antigenemia in NC is less than 1%, the threshold that defines the filarial endemic areas for WHO.

This paper describes results of a longitudinal study of changes in levels of PC-Ag in response to diethylcarbamazine (DEC) therapy as measured by two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and Western blotting. One hundred thirty-two residents of a bancroftian filariasis-endemic area of Papua New Guinea (PNG) were treated with a 72 mg/kg dose of DEC. A macrofilaricidal effect was seen with this dose of DEC as 34% of the treated subjects had localized side effects and long-term decreases in microfilariae (mf) counts were observed 12 months after treatment. The PC-Ag levels were reduced to 72%, 52%, and 51% of pretreatment values at 21 days and at six and 12 months after treatment. These decreases, observed by IRMA, were specifically associated with loss of the Mr 200,000 PC-Ag detected by immunoadsorption and Western blotting. From drug treatment data, the maximum half-life of PC-Ag in circulation was calculated to be 50 days, assuming a first-order decay process. This maximum half-life indicates that persistent antigenemia observed in the majority of treated subjects could only result from the survival of adult worms. In the absence of methods to directly demonstrate W. bancrofti adult worms, detection of serum PC-Ag levels provides a sensitive indirect measure of the dynamics of adult worm populations.

However, it is important to understand the potential for transmission in natural vectors to maximize the success of elimination efforts. Primary vectors in Papua New Guinea (n = 1209) were dissected following exposure to microfilaremic blood (range 8-233 mf/20 microl). We examined density dependent and species-specific parasite prevalence, intensity and yield, barriers to parasite development as well as impacts on mosquito survival. We observed strikingly different parasite prevalence and yield among closely related species. Prevalence of infective stage larvae (L3s) ranged from 4.2% to 23.7% in An. punctulatus, 24.5% to 68.6% in An. farauti s.s. and 61.9% to 100% in An. hinesorum at low and high density exposures, respectively. Injection experiments revealed the greatest barrier to parasite development involved passage from the midgut into the hemocoel. The ratio of L3 to ingested mf at low densities was higher in An. hinesorum (yield = 1.0) and An. farauti s.s. (yield = 0.5) than has been reported in other anopheline vectors. There was a negative relationship between mosquito survival and bloodmeal mf density. In An. farauti s.s., increased parasite yield and survival at low densities suggest greater competence at low microfilaremias.

Examples in French Polynesia]",Description:"[Some pathogens are known to be transmitted to humans by hematophagous insects. Control of diseases caused by arthropod-borne pathogens has usually been carried out by vector control using insecticides. The response of many vectors to insecticidal pressures often results in selection of resistant populations. Under field conditions, resistance is usually controlled by genes. Susceptibility or resistance to pathogens are usually determined by relatively simple genetic mechanisms. The frequency of such genes within a population will be influenced by evolutionary forces and interpopulation differences in levels of susceptibility to pathogens can be estimated. In view to understand the evolution of selected traits (insecticide resistance or vector capacity), analyses of gene flow provide information on population local dispersion patterns which is critical in vector control, indicating the distance of dispersal of vectors. Given that mosquitoes colonize various restricted and differentiated habitats, studies of mosquito populations appear especially promising for the understanding of vector genetic structure, vector transmission, disease epidemiology and disease control. Knowledge of patterns of gene flow and dispersal rates are useful to define geographic structure of mosquito populations from French Polynesia in relation with the transmission of a parasite (Bancroftian filariasis worm) or a virus (dengue viruses) or with their capacity to resist to insecticides. (1) Experimental infections of various geographic strains of Aedes polynesiensis for Wuchereria bancrofti show differences in the vectorial efficiency related to the geographic origin of the mosquito strain. Mosquitoes were more efficient intermediate hosts when infected with sympatric W. bancrofti. Mosquito strains from the Society archipelago developed the highest proportion of infective stage larvae and exhibited the lowest mortality rate. Isoenzyme frequency differences among Ae. polynesiensis populations confirms the genetic divergence of geographic isolated populations from crab holes. (2) A study on the genetic structure of Aedes aegypti, a vector of dengue viruses, shows a low level of genetic exchanges between mosquito populations. Genetic differentiation is probably due to insecticidal pressure which tends to structure mosquitoes for their oral susceptibility to dengue type 2 virus. The occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fryer in French Polynesia during the last few years was likely due to the dispersal of dengue viruses via viremic people rather than via infected vectors. (3) The analysis of the distribution of insecticide resistance genes in relation to genetic structure and gene now in Culex quinquefasciatus show that the frequency of resistance genes to organophosphorous insecticides is correlated to human displacements. The resistance genes have first been imported in French Polynesia through the international airport and dispersal of these genes through other islands was proceeded lia the local commercial traffic.]",Year:"1999",Authors:"Failloux, A.B., Rodhain, F.",Journal:"Annales de la Societe Entomologique de France",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"35(1)",Pages:"1-16","Work Location":["French Polynesia"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["French"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"660",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Evaluation of the program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in Vanuatu following two years of mass drug administration implementation: results and methodologic approach",Description:"This report presents the results of the Vanuatu mid-term evaluation of the lymphatic filariasis elimination program being implemented countrywide.

However, a major unresolved question remains: what are reasonable stopping points for these programmes? Recent theoretical work has highlighted how the ecological complexity and heterogeneity inherent in the transmission dynamics of macroparasites can result in elimination thresholds that vary between local communities. Here, we examine the empirical evidence for this hypothesis and its implications for the global elimination of the major macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis, by applying a novel Bayesian computer simulation procedure to fit a dynamic model of the transmission of this parasitic disease to field data from nine villages with different ecological and geographical characteristics. Baseline lymphatic filariasis microfilarial age-prevalence data from three geographically distinct endemic regions, across which the major vector populations implicated in parasite transmission also differed, were used to fit and calibrate the relevant vector-specific filariasis transmission models.

Here, we use an age-structured dynamical model of lymphatic filariasis transmission to show how a quantitative understanding of the dynamic processes underlying infection persistence and extinction is key to evaluating the eradicability of this macroparasitic disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the persistence and extinction dynamics of lymphatic filariasis by undertaking a numerical equilibrium analysis of a deterministic model of parasite transmission, based on varying values of the initial L3 larval density in the system. The results highlighted the likely occurrence of complex dynamics in parasite transmission with three major outcomes for the eradicability of filariasis. First, both vector biting and worm breakpoint thresholds are shown to be complex dynamic entities with values dependent on the nature and magnitude of vector-and host specific density-dependent processes and the degree of host infection aggregation prevailing in endemic communities. Second, these thresholds as well as the potential size of the attractor domains and hence system resilience are strongly dependent on peculiarities of infection dynamics in different vector species. Finally, the existence of multiple stable states indicates the presence of hysteresis nonlinearity in the filariasis system dynamics in which infection thresholds for infection invasion are lower but occur at higher biting rates than do the corresponding thresholds for parasite elimination. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The variable dynamic nature of thresholds and parasite system resilience reflecting both initial conditions and vector species-infection specificities, and the existence of hysteresis loop phenomenon, suggests that eradication of filariasis may require taking a more flexible and locally relevant approach to designing elimination programmes compared to the current command and control approach advocated by the global programme.",Year:"2008",Authors:"Gambhir, M., Michael, E.",Journal:"PLoS ONE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"3(8)",Pages:"e2874","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_662_Gambhir_Michael_2008_PLOS_ONE_mplex_ecological_dynamics_and_eradicability_of_the_vector_borne_macroparasitic_disease,_lymphatic_filariasis.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"663",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"A multicenter evaluation of diagnostic tools to define endpoints for programs to eliminate bancroftian filariasis",Description:"Successful mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns have brought several countries near the point of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) elimination.

One community survey and one school survey were performed in each country.

The main finding is that a large proportion of observed mf-negatives may be 'true' zeros, arising from the absence of macrofilarial infections or unmated adult worms, rather than being attributable to the blood sampling process. The corresponding mf distribution should then follow a Poisson mixture, arising from the sampling of mf positives, with an additional proportion of 'true' mf-zeros. This hypothesis is supported by analysis of observed Wuchereria bancrofti mf distributions from Southern India, Japan and Fiji, in which zero-truncated Poisson mixtures fit mf-positive counts more effectively than distributions including the observed zeros. The fits of two Poisson mixtures, the negative binomial and the Sichel distribution, are compared. The Sichel provides a slightly better empirical description of the mf density distribution; reasons for this improvement, and a discussion of the relative merits of the two distributions, are presented.

Agreement between dilutions (parallelism) was good in sera without specific antibody, but the presence of even modest levels of antibody resulted in nonparallelism in about one-half of the tested sera from endemic areas. Significant reduction in detectable BmA occurred when low levels of specific antibody (less than 1 microgram/ml) were added to BmA containing sera.

The persistence of transmission may be partly related to the highly efficient Aedes vectors. The assessment of pathogen transmission by mosquito vectors and of vector control relies on the ability to capture mosquitoes efficiently. The aims of this study are to compare trapping methods to capture LF-infected mosquitoes and determine the role in transmission of the species of Aedes mosquitoes in the area. METHODS: Fasitoo-Tai village was the chosen site because of persistent transmission despite annual mass drug administration. Sampling methods included BioGents Sentinel (BGS) trap, human-baited collections (HBC) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) trap. BGS and CDC traps were baited with BG-lure, CO2, and/or octenol. Individual trap locations were geo-located and efficiency of sampling methods was evaluated using a randomized Latin-square design in two locations. Number of mosquitoes collected (male and female), as well as species for each trapping method were determined. Additionally, Ae. polynesiensis and Ae. (Finlaya) spp. females were pooled by trap method and analysed for filarial DNA. Infection prevalence was estimated using the PoolScreen software. RESULTS: The BGS trap with any type of bait collected more mosquitoes compared to both the CDC trap and the HBC. The BGS trap baited with BG-lure collected more mosquitoes than with CO2 and octenol. There were no significant differences between trapping methods in terms of proportions of infected females collected. The prevalence of filarial infection in Ae. polynesiensis and Ae. (Finlaya) spp. was estimated at 4.7% and 0.67% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of the BGS trap for research on and surveillance of the mosquito vectors of LF in Samoa.

The availability of microfilarial counts, repeated on many people over 4(1/2) years, suggested that these estimates could be made for Wuchereria bancrofti. Important values that were calculated are the duration of patency for single infections (2(1/2) years), the maximum density of microfilariae achieved by 1 female (70/60 mm(3) of peripheral blood), the average output of larvae by a female during her lifetime (1.32x10(7)), the death rate of mated females (0.02-0.05 per month), the average load of reproducing female worms per blood-positive person (6.91 for men, 6.07 for women, 2.93 for children), and the average total load of worms in infected people (11.18 for men, 7.70 for women, 4.02 for children).The implications of the approach taken are important from the standpoints of epidemiology and control.

LF was endemic in Solomon Islands but in the 2010-2020 Strategic Plan of the Global Programme to Eliminate LF, Solomon Islands was listed as non-endemic for LF. In countries now declared free of LF an important question is what monitoring strategy should be used to detect any residual foci of LF? METHODS: The index case, a 44 year old male, presented to Atoifi Adventist Hospital, Malaita, Solomon Islands in April 2011 with elephantiasis of the lower leg. Persistent swelling had commenced 16 months previously. He was negative for antigen by TropBio Og4C3 ELISA and for microfilaria. A week later a survey of 197 people aged from 1 year to 68 years was conducted at Alasi, the index case's village, by a research team from Atoifi Adventist Hospital and Atoifi College of Nursing. This represented 66.3% of the village population. Blood was collected between 22:00 and 03:00 by finger-prick and made into thick smears to detect microfilaria and collected onto filter paper for W. bancrofti antigen tests. A second group of 110 specimens was similarly collected from residents of the Hospital campus and inpatients. W. bancrofti antigen was tested for using the Trop-Bio Og4C3 test. RESULTS: One sample (1/307) from an 18 year old male from Alsai was positive for W. bancrofti antigen. No samples were positive for microfilaria. Although antigen-positivity indicated a live worm, the case was regarded as having been acquired some years previously. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that when LF has been eliminated from a country, a case of elephantiasis should be a trigger to conduct a survey of the case's community using a decision pathway. W. bancrofti antigen should be tested for with screening for microfilariae in antigen positive cases.

The total data set comprises 90,635 subject exposures and includes individuals of all ages and both genders. Results are presented for hospital-based studies, laboratory studies, active surveillance of microfilaria-positive and microfilaria-negative individuals, and passive monitoring in both community-based studies and mass treatment programmes of individuals treated with albendazole (n = 1538), ivermectin (9822), DEC (576), albendazole + ivermectin (7470), albendazole + DEC (69,020), or placebo (1144). The most rigorous monitoring, which includes haematological and biochemical laboratory parameters pre- and post-treatment, provides no evidence that consistent changes are induced by any treatment; the majority of abnormalities appear to be sporadic, and the addition of albendazole to either ivermectin or DEC does not increase the frequency of abnormalities. Both DEC and ivermectin show, as expected, an adverse event profile compatible with the destruction of microfilariae. The addition of albendazole to either single-drug treatment regimen does not appear to increase the frequency or intensity of events seen with these microfilaricidal drugs when used alone. Direct observations indicated that the level of adverse events, both frequency and intensity, was correlated with the level of microfilaraemia. In non microfilaraemic individuals, who form 80-90% of the 'at risk' populations to be treated in most national public health programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF), the event profile with the compounds alone or in combination does not differ significantly from that of placebo.

The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis aims to eliminate LF as a public health problem by the year 2020, primarily through repeated Mass Drug Administration (MDA). The Pacific region programme commenced in 1999. By June 2007, five of the eleven countries classified as endemic had completed five MDA campaigns and post-MDA prevalence surveys to assess their progress. We review available programme data and discuss their implications for other LF elimination programs in developing countries. METHODS: Reported MDA coverage and results from initial surveys and post-MDA surveys of LF using the immunochromatographic test (ICT) from these five Pacific Island countries (Tonga, Niue, Vanuatu, Samoa and Cook Islands) were analysed to provide an understanding of their quality and programme progress towards LF elimination. Denominator data reported by each country programme for 2001 was compared to official sources to assess the accuracy of MDA coverage data. RESULTS: Initial survey results from these five countries revealed an ICT prevalence of between 2.7 and 8.6 percent in individuals tested prior to commencement of the programme. Country MDA coverage results varied depending on the source of denominator data. Of the five countries in this case study, three countries (Tonga, Niue and Vanuatu) reached the target prevalence of <1% antigenaemia following five rounds of MDA. However, endpoint data could not be reliably compared to baseline data as survey methodology varied. CONCLUSION: Accurate and representative baseline and post-campaign prevalence data is crucial for determining program effectiveness and the factors contributing to effectiveness.

LF is recognized as endemic in 73 countries and territories; an estimated 1.39 billion (thousand million) people live in areas where filariasis has been endemic and is now targeted for treatment [1]. Global momentum to eliminate LF has developed over the past 15 years as a result not only of research demonstrating the value of single-dose treatment strategies and point-of-care diagnostic tools, but also of both the generous donations of medicines from the following committed pharmaceutical companies: GlaxoSmithKline (albendazole), Merck (ivermectin), and Eisai (diethylcarbamazine; DEC), and the essential financial support for programme implementation from the donor community [2]. During 2011, more than 50 countries carried out LF elimination programmes, and more than 500 million people received mass treatment [1].

This is challenging in areas where the day-biting Aedes polynesiensis is endemic, such as Samoa, since in previous studies no geographical clustering of infection has been demonstrated. Another challenge for this low prevalence phase is the choice of diagnostic assay as testing for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) or microfilariae (Mf) alone may not have adequate sensitivity. This could be solved by using the commercially available filariasis Cellabs enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA) to measure antibody. In the current study five Samoan villages were chosen based on previous epidemiological assessments to represent a range of infection prevalences. CFA, Mf, and antibody levels in children </= 10 years had been recorded and results linked to household of residence and/or primary school of attendance. To ascertain the location of exposure, two scenarios based on potential foci of transmission around communities and schools were explored.

The epidemiologic features and natural history of Wuchereria bancrofti infection in this geographic region, however, have not been well-defined. The objective of this study was to assess the parasitological and clinical features of bancroftian filariasis in a community in East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea. In a village of 99 individuals, the overall prevalence of microfilaremia was 68%. The microfilarial carrier rate was high in those less than or equal to 10 years (62%), remained elevated in the 11-20, 21-30, and 31-40 age groups (42-55%), and peaked in subjects greater than or equal to 41 years old (90%). The geometric mean level of parasitemia in all subjects with patent infection was 3,198 microfilariae/ml blood. This value was 78 parasites/ml in the less than or equal to 10-year-old age group, increased to 1,753 in 21 to 30-year-olds and was markedly elevated in subjects greater than or equal to 41 years old (6, 792 microfilariae/ml). Acute symptoms of filariasis (lymphadenitis and lymphangitis) were initially noted in individuals between the ages of 11 and 20 years (30%). Obstructive disease, manifested as elephantiasis and hydroceles, was present in 64 and 79% of 31-40 and greater than or equal to 41-year-olds, respectively. These data suggest that intense transmission of W. bancrofti infection occurs at an early age in this area of East Sepik Province; patent infection remains high in older age groups.

The purpose of this paper is to present the evidence base for decision-makers on the cost and cost-effectiveness of lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis prevention, treatment, and control. A systematic review of the published literature was conducted. All studies that contained primary or secondary data on costs or cost-effectiveness of prevention and control were considered. A total of 52 papers were included for LF and 24 papers were included for onchocerciasis. Large research gaps exist on the synergies and cost of integrating NTD prevention and control programs, as well as research on the role of health information systems, human resource systems, service delivery, and essential medicines and technology for elimination. The literature available on costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions is also generally older, extremely focal geographically and of limited usefulness for developing estimates of the global economic burden of these diseases and prioritizing among various intervention options. Up to date information on the costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions for LF and onchocerciasis prevention are needed given the vastly expanded funding base for the control and elimination of these diseases.

These rates were somewhat higher than those found in surveys made in the same villages among villagers of the same ages some 20 years previously. A mass treatment programme with diethylcarbamazine was then decided on.Preliminary treatment with a single total regimen of 72 mg of the drug per kg of body weight, given in 12 doses of 6 mg/kg, was administered in several villages over a period of 6 months. Among villagers of all ages at the end of 3 years, the microfilarial rate was 7.3% and the MfD(50) value was 2.

Many studies to optimize the dosage and treatment schedule of DEC followed, and, based on the results, control programs with various regimens were implemented in different endemic areas/countries. By the mid 1970s, with endorsement by the WHO Expert Committee on Filariasis (3rd report, 1974), the standard DEC regimen for W. bancrofti infection in mass treatment had been established in principle: a total dose of 72 mg/kg of body weight given in 12 divided doses, once weekly or monthly, at 6 mg/kg each. Not long after the committee report, the efficacy of annual single-dose treatment at 6 mg/kg, which is only one twelfth of the WHO-recommended dose in a year, was reported effective in French Polynesia (study period: 1973-78), and later in Samoa (study period: 1979-81). These results were published between 1978 and 1985 in the Bulletin of WHO but received little attention. In the mid 1980s, the efficacy of ivermectin, the first-choice drug for onchocerciasis, against lymphatic filariae came to light. Since the effect at a single dose was remarkable, and often better than DEC, it was predicted that the newly introduced drug would replace DEC. Treatment experiments with ivermectin increased quickly in number. Meanwhile, annual single-dose mass drug administration (MDA) with DEC at 6 mg/kg was under scrutiny in Samoa and Fiji. In the early 1990s, the Samoan study, which covered the entire population of 160,000 with 3 annual MDAs, reported a significant reduction in microfilaria (mf) prevalence and mean mf density, while in Fiji, the efficacy of 5 rounds of annual MDA (total dose, 30 mg/kg) was shown to be as effective as 28 multi-dose MDA spread over 2 years (6 weekly plus 22 monthly treatments at 5 mg/kg; total dose, 140 mg/kg). Several additional studies carried out in Samoa in relation to the annual single-dose MDAs revealed that low density mf carriers, who have a very low mf count of 1-20/ml of venous blood, could not play a significant role in filariasis transmission.From around 1990, studies on spaced low-dose DEC treatments and various types of combination chemotherapy with DEC and ivermectin increased. Albendazole, a well-known anti-intestinal helminths agent, was later added to the combination. The main findings of these studies with W. bancrofti are: (i) a single dose of DEC at 6 mg/kg reduced mean mf density by ca. 90% 1 year after treatment; (ii) the same dose could damage/kill adult worms; (iii) a single dose of ivermectin at ca. 400 microg/kg was more effective than DEC in reducing mf density during the first year and was similarly or less effective in the second year; (iv) ivermectin probably could not kill adult worms; (v) a single combined dose of albendazole (400 mg) and DEC (6 mg/kg) was effective to reduce mf density by 85 to nearly 100% 12-24 months after treatment; and (vi) ivermectin or albendazole included in the combination chemotherapy produced "beyond-filariasis" benefits: clearance/reduction of intestinal helminths, and, additionally, in the case of ivermectin, skin-dwelling ectoparasites.The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) started its worldwide activities in 2000, with the target of elimination by 2020. The basic strategy is to conduct annual single-dose MDAs for 4-6 years. In 2000-2007, a minimum of 570 million individuals were treated in 48 of 83 endemic countries. The drugs used are DEC 6 mg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg in most countries, or ivermectin 200-400 microg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg particularly in onchocerciasis endemic countries in Africa. (MDAs with DEC alone had been used in India.)The GPELF achieved impressive results in terms of parasitological cure/improvement, clinical benefits, social and economic impacts, etc. However, the most impressive result of all was the programme's success in mobilizing hundreds of millions of local people, who not only took drugs but many of them actively supported MDAs as drug distributors and volunteers. Beyond filariasis, the role people can play in supplementing rural health services is now a topic of discussion and a source of hope for a new sustainable system.`,Year:"2011",Authors:"Kimura, E.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"39(1)",Pages:"17-30","Work Location":["Fiji","Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_744_Kimura_2011_TROP_MED_HLTH_GPELF_review_DEC_Samoa_and_Fiji.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"745",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Control of lymphatic filariasis by annual single-dose diethylcarbamazine treatments",Description:"It has long been stressed that diethylcarbamazine citrate must be given at a total dosage of 72 mg per kilogram of body weight in 12 divided doses of 6 mg kg(-1) to obtain maximum effect against Wuchereria bancrofti.

The mosquito infectivity produced by the low-density carriers accounted for only 2.16% of the total infectivity produced by all the carriers, suggesting that these carriers are of minor importance in the transmission of filariasis.

L1 had a U-shaped growth in length, while widths followed an S-shaped function. L2 had an S-shaped growth in length and width. Growth in length of L3 was also S-shaped, while widths had an asymptotic size following a period of rapid shrinkage. The greatest difference between length and width was in stage 3 where the length was over 75 times greater than the width. The ratio of length to width was approximately 50 for microfilariae and only 10 for the L1 ('sausage') stage. Characteristic mean length (and width) were approximately 280(7) microm for microfilariae, approximately 181 microm for L1 at their smallest, and approximately 1584(22) microm for L3 infective larvae. There was a great increase in length during stage 2 from approximately 322(27) to approximately 982(31) microm. Stage duration decreased with increasing temperature while growth rate increased, giving steeper growth curves. There was no effect of temperature on size, except for L3, which were shorter when mosquitoes were reared at higher temperature. It appears that larval growth is a continuous process from microfilariae to the young L3 stage, and continuously modifies the larval parasite aspect, even within each stage. Thus, information on larval shape may be used as an age indicator and in some cases, may give an estimation on time elapsed since infection of the vector. An important demographic parameter used in most mathematical models describing transmission of parasites by insect vectors is the length of the gonotrophic cycle of the vector, i.e. the time interval between two successive blood-meals. Usual methods for computing such a parameter are based on mark-recapture techniques. However, reliable estimates need substantial capture rates, which are not always possible. This paper presents another approach in which marked mosquitoes are those naturally infected by W. bancrofti. For one mosquito, the time since infection is simply the age of the developing larval parasite. Our method first expresses the age of larval parasite as a fraction of total development time (from microfilariae entering the vector to L3 larvae) using a regression model based on measurements of the parasite's length and width. This fraction of development is then converted to a chronological age since infection, using a back-calculation procedure involving ambient temperatures and growth rates of W. bancrofti larvae in the vector. The method is applied to wild caught Ae. polynesiensis in French Polynesia to compute the length of the gonotrophic cycle. This mosquito species comes to bite approximately 3, 6-7 and 9 days after a first infectious blood-meal. Then the length of the gonotrophic cycle may be of 3-4 days.",Year:"2002",Authors:"Lardeux, F., Cheffort, J.",Journal:"International Journal for Parasitology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"32(6)",Pages:"705-716","Work Location":["French Polynesia"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"785",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Wuchereria bancrofti (Filariidea: Dipetalonematidae) and its vector Aedes polynesiensis (Diptera: Culicidae) in a French Polynesian village",Description:"In March 1991, a study on Wuchereria bancrofti (Cobbold, 1887) infection rates in its vector, Aedes polynesiensis Marks, was carried out in a village of French Polynesia.

We examined the seroprevalence and spatial epidemiology of LF post-MDA to inform strategies for ongoing surveillance and to reduce resurgence risk. METHODS: ELISA for LF antigen (Og4C3) and antibodies (Wb123, Bm14) were performed on a geo-referenced serum bank of 807 adults collected in 2010. Risk factors assessed for association with sero-positivity included age, sex, years lived in American Samoa, and occupation. Geographic clustering of serological indicators was investigated to identify spatial dependence and household-level clustering. RESULTS: Og4C3 antigen of >128 units (positive) were found in 0.75% (95% CI 0.3-1.6%) of participants, and >32 units (equivocal plus positive) in 3.2% (95% CI 0.6-4.7%). Seroprevalence of Wb123 and Bm14 antibodies were 8.1% (95% CI 6.3-10.2%) and 17.9% (95% CI 15.3-20.7%) respectively. Antigen-positive individuals were identified in all ages, and antibody prevalence higher in older ages. Prevalence was higher in males, and inversely associated with years lived in American Samoa. Spatial distribution of individuals varied significantly with positive and equivocal levels of Og4C3 antigen, but not with antibodies. Using Og4C3 cutoff points of >128 units and >32 units, average cluster sizes were 1,242 m and 1,498 m, and geographical proximity of households explained 85% and 62% of the spatial variation respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High-risk populations for LF in American Samoa include adult males and recent migrants. We identified locations and estimated the size of possible residual foci of antigen-positive adults, demonstrating the value of spatial analysis in post-MDA surveillance.

Analysis of the microfilarial densities at different ages and the number of anatomical sites showing lymph gland enlargement or elephantiasis have been used to provide evidence on the clustering of infections and pathogenesis. Although there is no evidence of clustering of risk of infection, there is evidence favouring the clustering of adult filariae in individuals. Nevertheless the number of sites of lymph node enlargement do not correspond with this finding and statistical evidence suggests that lymph-node enlargement is not necessarily associated with the near presence in the body of adult filariae, whether dead or alive. Males of Indian ethnic origin showed a higher prevalence of elephantiasis than males of Fijian ethnic origin, but women of either ethnic race showed prevalences lower than those of men. The onset of elephantiasis at a site does not directly reflect the number of infections sustained in the local area, but it appears that filariasis first induces for a limited period a proneness to elephantiasis. During this period a random and discrete event may induce the onset of elephantiasis. The nature of the event is unknown, but it probably is not trauma.",Year:"1971",Authors:"Mataika, J.U., Dando, B.C., Spears, G.F.S., Macnamara, F.N.",Journal:"Journal of Hygiene",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"69(2)",Pages:"297-306","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022172400021525",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"808",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Efficacy of five annual single doses of diethylcarbamazine for treatment of lymphatic filariasis in Fiji",Description:"Annual single-dose treatments with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) at a dose of 6 mg/kg have been reported effective in reducing microfilariae (mf) rate and density and applicable to large-scale filariasis control campaigns.

The so-called "non-periodic" Pacific form of Wuchereria bancrofti in fact shows a well-marked and relatively constant periodicity. The amplitude of this periodicity is low, which may account for the difficulty of detecting it in small clinical samples. The periodicity is well adapted to the biting cycle of Aedes polynesiensis, though less so than that of the "semi-periodic" Brugia malayi to forest Mansonioides. Microfilarial periodicity is discussed in the light of recent work on circadian rhythms in other animals and it is suggested that certain possibilities have been given insufficient weight. The use of the term "migration" to describe microfilarial translocation within the host may have given rise to misunderstanding but it is in good agreement with current concepts of migration.

By analogy with previous work, the analysis involves the comparison of observed field patterns of infection with epidemiological patterns predicted by a mathematical model of parasite immunity. Unlike most other human helminths, which are transmitted by ingestion or dermal penetration, exposure to infection with lymphatic filariasis can be measured explicitly in terms of vector mosquito biting rates, thereby also allowing, probably for the first time, examination of the suggested role of exposure in generating herd immunity to macroparasites. Observed field patterns in this study were derived from 19 different published studies, which gave parallel estimates of community exposure rates and the corresponding age--prevalence patterns of infection, while predictions of the epidemiological impact of herd immunity were obtained using a catalytic model framework. The results provide the first conclusive evidence to date that variations in the observed age--prevalence patterns of infection in filariasis can be effectively explained by the occurrence of an exposure-driven acquisition of herd immunity.

The results presented here suggest that although the overall prevalence of filariasis cases is 2.0% globally (approximately totalling 119 million cases), the disease continues to be of considerable local importance, particularly in India and Sub-Saharan Africa.

We used a combined analysis of empirical community data describing the association between infection and chronic disease prevalence, mathematical modelling, and economic analyses to identify and evaluate the feasibility of setting an infection target level at which the chronic pathology attributable to lymphatic filariasis - lymphoedema of the extremities and hydroceles - becomes negligible in the face of continuing transmission as a first stage option in achieving the elimination of this parasitic disease. The results show that microfilaria prevalences below a threshold of 3.55% at a blood sampling volume of 1 ml could constitute readily achievable and sustainable targets to control lymphatic filarial disease. They also show that as a result of the high marginal cost of curing the last few individuals to achieve elimination, maximal benefits can occur at this threshold.

The most expensive and most effective strategy in reducing community mf prevalence over 2 years was DEC salt intervention, followed in order of costs by the standard, low monthly and semi-annual DEC strategies. The most cost effective strategy was the low monthly DEC treatment. Cost and sensitivity analyses, however, suggest that the optimal choice of mass DEC strategy for reducing mf is very sensitive to programme design parameters. In particular, the results demonstrate that if the salt delivery structure is simplified, DEC salt has the potential to be the dominant intervention for filariasis control. The results suggest that economies of scale considerations might militate against the adoption of this intervention for large-scale applications, unless perhaps offset by its potential for cost recovery by direct patient purchase.

Despite the occurrence of a number of studies investigating mosquito survival after infection with filarial worms, there remains conflicting evidence from both laboratory and field experiments as to the existence and mechanism for parasite-induced mortality among filarial mosquitoes. Here, we used a mixed effects meta-analytical framework to combine the data from all available vector-human host blood feeding experiments to evaluate the evidence for the impact of parasite load on the mortality rates of the three major lymphatic filariasis transmitting mosquito genera, Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquitoes, over the extrinsic incubation period of parasitic infection. The results show that, despite the application of this approach, or in the case of Anopheles using a convention fixed effects logistic regression analysis supplemented with additional survival analysis of longitudinal data, no strong association between mortality rate and microfilariae (mf) uptake for either of the three mosquito genera is apparent in the combined data. Instead, a key finding is that study effects played a more crucial role in determining the levels of mortality observed in these experimental studies. This was most revealing in the case of Culex, given that the largest single study in terms of both the number of data points and range of mf intensities, in contrast to smaller studies, showed a significant positive association between mf intensity and mortality, indicating that in this genus at least, the detrimental effect of infection may be manifested only at the highest mf intakes. Although no density dependence in vector mortality was also observed for Aedes, possibly because of the use of restricted human mf intensity range in previous studies, an intriguing finding was that a significantly higher overall mortality was observed for this genus over mfintake ranges that produced much less corresponding mortality in Culex and Anopheles. The results also indicate that currently very little can be said about the survival rate of Anopheles mosquitoes infected with filarial worms because of the striking paucity of data for this genus.

Some experts, however, consider that longer periods of treatment might be necessary in certain high prevalence and transmission environments based upon past unsuccessful field experience and modelling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To evaluate predictors of success in a LF control program we conducted an ecological study during a pre-existing MDA program. We studied 27 villages in Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, from two areas with different infection rates before MDA. We undertook surveys to collect information on variables potentially having an influence on the outcome of the program, including epidemiological (baseline prevalence of infection, immigration rate), entomological (vector density) and operational (treatment coverage, vector control strategies) variables. The success in a village was defined using variables related to the infection (circulating filarial antigenemia prevalence < 1%) and transmission (antigenemia prevalence < 1 in 1000 children born since start of MDA). 8709 people were involved in the MDA program and average coverage rates were around 70%. The overall prevalence of filariasis fell from an initial 17.91% to 3.76% at round 5 (p < 0.001). Viewed on a village by village basis, 12/27 (44%) villages achieved success. In multivariate analysis, low baseline prevalence was the only factor predicting both success in reducing infection rates (OR 19,26; CI 95% 1,12 to 331,82) and success in preventing new infections (OR 27,44; CI 95% 1,05 to 719,6).

In endemic areas, most infected individuals are asymptomatic but may harbor microfilariae or filarial antigens in their peripheral blood. Microscopy remains the reference diagnostic tool for the identification of microfilariae but is weakly sensitive. The diagnosis of Wuchereria bancrofti infection was dramatically altered by the development of filarial antigen tests, which are easy to perform but expensive for routine use. Lymphatic filariasis is responsible for acquired eosinophilia and blood eosinophil count is commonly used as a screening tool in endemic areas. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed all the results of eosinophil counts, antigen and microfilariae detection performed in our laboratory over a 24-month period.

Combinations and DEC alone had a similar impact on CFA level. CFA clearance was observed in amicrofilaremic but not in microfilaremic persons in all DEC-containing treatments. However, the highest clearance rate was observed in persons treated with DEC at 6 mg/kg combined with ivermectin.

In order to standardize our PCR method and refine our protocol to assess filarial infection levels in mosquitoes, we compared dissection of the vector, Aedes polynesiensis, with the poolscreening polymerase chain reaction (PS-PCR) assay. METHODS: (1) Mosquitoes were collected in human landing catches in five areas in Moorea island, French Polynesia. (2) A fraction of the captured mosquitoes was dissected for Wuchereria bancrofti larvae. (3) Laboratory-reared mosquitoes (uninfected as well as experimentally infected ones) were repeatedly tested to optimize a PS-PCR protocol (DNA extracts from 1-50 pooled mosquitoes were tested with an internal standardized system and primers specific for the Ssp1 repeat sequence. PCR products were analysed by gel electrophoresis). (4) Another fraction of the captured mosquitoes was assayed by PS-PCR according the optimized protocol. RESULTS: The prevalence of field-mosquito infection with W. bancrofti ranged from 1 to 8 % by dissection (L1-L3) and point estimates of infection prevalence, as assayed by PS-PCR, ranged from 0.4 to 3.7 %. There was a moderately strong correlation between larval infection rates as determined by dissection and PCR. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the PS-PCR assay is specific and highly sensitive for detecting parasite DNA. We obtained similar although not identical results with dissections of mosquitoes.

Sequences were assembled for each isolate and annotated with reference to the mt genome sequence for Brugia malayi. The length of the W. bancrofti mt genome is approximately 13,637 nucleotides, contains 2 ribosomal RNAs (rrns), 22 transfer RNAs (trns), 12 protein-coding genes, and is characterized by a 74.6% AT content. The W. bancrofti mt gene order is identical to that reported for Onchocerca volvulus, Dirofilaria immitis, Setaria digitata and B. malayi. In addition to using translational start codons identified previously in the mt protein-coding genes of other filarial nematodes, W. bancrofti appears to be unique in using TGT as a translational start codon. Similarly, use of incomplete stop codons in mt protein-coding genes appears to be more common in W. bancrofti than in other human filarial parasites. The complete mt genome sequence reported here provides new genetic markers for investigating phylogenetic and geographic relationships between isolates, and assessing population diversity within endemic regions.

Singleplex assays detected Wb, Pf and Pv DNA in 32%, 19% and 15% of the mosquito pools, respectively, either alone or together with other parasites. Multiplex assay results agreed with singleplex results in most cases.

Preventive chemotherapy enables the regular and coordinated administration of safe, single-dose medications delivered through mass drug administration (MDA).

We compared multiple antigen methods during the course of baseline clinical prevalence studies in Papua, New Guinea in over 800 subjects. We found that the ICT and Og4C3 filter paper techniques and using blood from the ICT card in the Og4C3 ELISA were equivalent in performance and that the serum Og4C3 ELISA test detected significantly more antigenic individuals.

Insecticide-treated bed nets are being widely used in areas in which filariasis and malaria are coendemic. METHODS: We studied five villages in which five annual mass administrations of antifilarial drugs, which were completed in 1998, reduced the transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti, one of the nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis. A total of 21,899 anopheles mosquitoes were collected for 26 months before and 11 to 36 months after bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticide were distributed in 2009. We evaluated the status of filarial infection and the presence of W. bancrofti DNA in anopheline mosquitoes before and after the introduction of insecticide-treated bed nets. We then used a model of population dynamics to estimate the probabilities of transmission cessation. RESULTS: Village-specific rates of bites from anopheline mosquitoes ranged from 6.4 to 61.3 bites per person per day before the bed-net distribution and from 1.1 to 9.4 bites for 11 months after distribution (P<0.001). During the same period, the rate of detection of W. bancrofti in anopheline mosquitoes decreased from 1.8% to 0.4% (P=0.005), and the rate of detection of filarial DNA decreased from 19.4% to 14.9% (P=0.13). The annual transmission potential was 5 to 325 infective larvae inoculated per person per year before the bed-net distribution and 0 after the distribution. Among all five villages with a prevalence of microfilariae of 2 to 38%, the probability of transmission cessation increased from less than 1.0% before the bed-net distribution to a range of 4.9 to 95% in the 11 months after distribution.

Their surveillance is hindered by a relative lack of attraction to light traps, necessitating the undesirable use of human bait collections with the inherent risks of pathogen transmission. The effectiveness of CDC- and EVS-type light traps baited with olfactory attractants was evaluated for these two Aedes species and the nocturnal Culex (Culex) quinquefasciatus Say in three sites in urban and semi-rural environments on Moorea in October/November 2003. Firstly, four CDC-type traps with light only, light with octenol, light with carbon dioxide (dry ice), and light with octenol plus carbon dioxide were operated continuously over four days with daily rotation to compensate for position effects. Secondly, two CDC- and two EVS-type traps with carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide plus octenol were operated continuously over four days with similar rotation. Variation was found in the numbers of the three species collected at the different sites, reflecting the relative availability of their preferred larval habitats. With the CDC traps in the first trial, the addition of octenol to the light did not significantly increase the collection of any species, the addition of carbon dioxide did significantly increase collection of all three species, while the addition of octenol to the light plus carbon dioxide did not significantly increase the collections further. In the second trial, there was no significant difference in the mean number of Ae. aegypti or Ae. polynesiensis collected in either EVS or CDC traps when baited with carbon dioxide or with octenol added.

Biting rates of both species tended to increase (but not always significantly) for each species in each region each month from the late dry season to the late wet season, and the north coast region had significantly higher biting rates of Ae. aegypti. Insemination rates of Ae. polynesiensis females (94.5-98.8%) were consistently greater than those of Ae. aegypti (87.5-93.5%) throughout the study, but there was no significant difference in the insemination rates of either species between months and regions. Parity rates were generally highest in north coast samples and lowest in west coast samples for both species and generally increased (albeit not always significantly) by month for each species, with a range of 52.9-88.8% for Ae. polynesiensis and 28.6-53.6% for Ae. aegypti, although the high gravid rate (15.8-45.9%) of Ae. aegypti samples (reflecting its feeding more than once in a gonotrophic cycle) confounded both intraspecific and interspecific comparisons. Filarial infection was rare in Ae. aegypti, although both W. bancrofti and D. immitis were recorded, and infection rates in Ae. polynesiensis increased through the study period in each region for both filarias, with up to 4.6% infected and 1.4% infective for W. bancrofti and up to 6.3% infected and 2.5% infective for D. immitis. For W. bancrofti, infection rates were significantly lower on the west coast and also in the dry season, whereas rates for infective stages were significantly greater in the late wet season. For D. immitis there was no significant difference in infection rates between regions, but rates were significantly greater in the late wet season. Rainfall in all months sustains populations of both vectors and explains the relatively few significant differences between seasons; however, the wet season may provide for increased vector abundance and longevity, and present a potentially increased risk for transmission.

Despite the health policy relevance, only little is known of the epidemiological profile of neglected diseases among EMGs. We reviewed country data from Australia, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam and found several overlaps between regions with high proportions of EMG population and high prevalence rates of neglected diseases (infections with soil-transmitted helminths, filarial worms, schistosomes, food-borne trematodes and cestodes). While the links are not always clearly evident and it is impossible to establish correlations among highly aggregated data without control variables-such as environmental factors-there appear indeed to be important linkages between EMGs, socio-economic status and prevalence of neglected diseases. Some determinants under consideration are lack of access to health care and general health status, poverty and social marginalization, as well as education and literacy. Further research is needed to deepen the understanding of these linkages and to determine their public health and socio-economic significance.

Recent work has indicated that locality-specific bio-ecological complexities affecting parasite transmission may complicate the prediction of LF extinction endpoints, casting uncertainty on the achievement of this initiative. One source of difficulty is the limited quantity and quality of data used to parameterize models of parasite transmission, implying the important need to update initially-derived parameter values. Sequential analysis of longitudinal data following annual MDAs will also be important to gaining new understanding of the persistence dynamics of LF. Here, we apply a Bayesian statistical-dynamical modelling framework that enables assimilation of information in human infection data recorded from communities in Papua New Guinea that underwent annual MDAs, into our previously developed model of parasite transmission, in order to examine these questions in LF ecology and control. RESULTS: Biological parameters underlying transmission obtained by fitting the model to longitudinal data remained stable throughout the study period. This enabled us to reliably reconstruct the observed baseline data in each community. Endpoint estimates also showed little variation. However, the updating procedure showed a shift towards higher and less variable values for worm kill but not for any other drug-related parameters. An intriguing finding is that the stability in key biological parameters could be disrupted by a significant reduction in the vector biting rate prevailing in a locality. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal invariance of biological parameters in the face of intervention perturbations indicates a robust adaptation of LF transmission to local ecological conditions. The results imply that understanding the mechanisms that underlie locally adapted transmission dynamics will be integral to identifying points of system fragility, and thus countermeasures to reliably facilitate LF extinction both locally and globally.",Year:"2013",Authors:"Singh, B.K., Bockarie, M.J., Gambhir, M., Siba, P.M., Tisch, D.J., Kazura, J., Michael, E.",Journal:"PLoS ONE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"8(6)",Pages:"e67004","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_966_Singh_et_al_2013_PLOS_ONE_Sequential_modeling_of_effects_of_Mass_drug_treatments_on_anopheline_mediated_LF_infection_in_PNG.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"967",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Population genetics of the filarial worm Wuchereria bancrofti in a post-treatment region of Papua New Guinea: insights into diversity and life history",Description:"BACKGROUND: Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb) is the primary causative agent of lymphatic filariasis (LF). Our studies of LF in Papua New Guinea (PNG) have shown that it is possible to reduce the prevalence of Wb in humans and mosquitoes through mass drug administration (MDA; diethylcarbamazine with/without ivermectin). While MDAs in the Dreikikir region through 1998 significantly reduced prevalence of Wb infection, parasites continue to be transmitted in the area. METHODS: We sequenced the Wb mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (CO1) gene from 16 people infected with Wb. Patients were selected from 7 villages encompassing both high and moderate annual transmission potentials (ATP). We collected genetic data with the objectives to (i) document contemporary levels of genetic diversity and (ii) distinguish between populations of parasites and hosts across the study area. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We discovered 109 unique haplotypes currently segregating in the Wb parasite population, with one common haplotype present in 15 out of 16 infections. We found that parasite diversity was similar among people residing within the same village and clustered within transmission zones. For example, in the high transmission area, diversity tended to be more similar between neighboring villages, while in the moderate transmission area, diversity tended to be less similar.

Current tools available to monitor LF are limited to diagnostic tests targeting DNA repeats, filarial antigens, and anti-filarial antibodies. While these tools are useful for detection and surveillance, elimination programs have yet to take full advantage of molecular typing for inferring infection history, strain fingerprinting, and evolution. To date, molecular typing approaches have included whole mitochondrial genomes, genotyping, targeted sequencing, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs). These studies have revealed much about Wb biology. For example, in one study in Papua New Guinea researchers identified 5 major strains that were widespread and many minor strains some of which exhibit geographic stratification. Genome data, while rare, has been utilized to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among taxa of the Onchocercidae (the clade of filarial nematodes) and identify gene synteny. Their phylogeny reveals that speciation from the common ancestor of both B. malayi and Wb occurred around 5-6 millions years ago with shared ancestry to other filarial nematodes as recent as 15 million years ago. These discoveries hold promise for gene discovery and identifying drug targets in species that are more amenable to in vivo experiments. Continued technological developments in whole genome sequencing and data analysis will likely replace many other forms of molecular typing, multiplying the amount of data available on population structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetics. Once widely available, the addition of population genetic data from genomic studies should hasten the elimination of LF parasites like Wb. Infectious disease control programs have benefited greatly from population genetics data and recently from population genomics data. However, while there is currently a surplus of data for diseases like malaria and HIV, there is a scarcity of this data for filarial nematodes. With the falling cost of genome sequencing, research on filarial nematodes could benefit from the addition of population genetics statistics and phylogenetics especially in dealing with elimination programs. A comprehensive review focusing on population genetics of filarial nematode does not yet exist. Here our goal is to provide a current overview of the molecular epidemiology of W. bancrofti (Wb) the primary causative agent of LF. We begin by reviewing studies utilizing molecular typing techniques with specific focus on genomic and population datasets. Next, we used whole mitochondrial genome data to construct a phylogeny and examine the evolutionary history of the Onchocercidae.

Mathematical models describing observed mf-L3 functional responses for each of the major three parasite-transmitting vector genera, Aedes, Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes, were fitted to paired mf-L3 data collated from all available studies in the published literature. Model parameters were estimated and compared by deriving and applying a data synthetic framework, based on applying a non-linear weighted regression model for fitting mathematical models to multistudy data. The results confirm previous findings of the existence of significant between-genera differences in the mf-L3 development relationship, particularly with regard to the occurrence of limitation in Culex mosquitoes and facilitation in Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes. New and unexpected findings regarding L3 development from ingested mf were discovered as follows: (1) for Culex, overcompensation in L3 development at higher intensities of mf (or a peaked mf-L3 functional response) was detected; (2) for Aedes mosquitoes, facilitation (with an apparent asymptotic constraint on L3 development at high mf densities) was shown to be the major process governing L3 development, and (3) for Anopheles, a stronger facilitation type of response with no apparent saturation in L3 development appears to govern L3 output from ingested mf.

Here, we use data on mosquito feeding experiments collated from the published literature to examine the available evidence regarding the functional form of the first component of this parasite-vector relationship for Wuchereria bancrofti (Filarioidea: Onchocercidae) causing Bancroftian filariasis, i.e. the rate of microfilariae (mf) uptake from the blood of infected humans by the feeding mosquito vector. Using a simple logarithmic regression model for describing the observed relationships between the mean numbers of mf ingested per mosquito and parasite load in humans in each study, and a linear mixed-effects meta-analytical framework for synthesizing the observed regressions across studies, we show here for the first time clear evidence for the existence of density-dependence in this process for all the three major filariasis transmitting mosquito vectors. An important finding of this study is that this regulation of mf uptake also varies significantly between the vector genera, being weakest in Culex, comparatively stronger in Aedes and most severe and occurring at significantly lower human mf loads in Anopheles mosquitoes. The analysis of the corresponding mf uptake prevalence data has further highlighted how density-dependence in mf uptake may influence the observed distributions of mf in vector populations. These results show that whereas strong regulation of mf uptake, especially when it leads to saturation in uptake at low human parasite intensities, can lead to static distributions of mf per mosquito with host parasite intensity, a weaker regulation of mf ingestion can give rise to changes in both mean mf loads and in the frequency distribution of parasites/mosquito with increasing human parasite intensity. These findings highlight the importance of considering local vector infection dynamics when attempting to predict the impacts of community-based filariasis control.

To examine its usefulness in a single filarial-endemic island assessed at two time points with markedly different levels of transmission, Ab to Wb123 was measured in sera collected from subjects from Mauke, Cook Islands in 1975 (no previous treatment) and 1992 (5 years after a one time island-wide treatment with diethylcarbamazine [DEC]). FINDINGS: Between 1975 and 1992, Wb transmission decreased dramatically as evidenced by reduced prevalences of microfilariae (31% vs. 5%) and circulating Ag (CAg, 49% vs. 16%). Age specific prevalence analysis showed a dramatic reduction in Wb123 Ab positivity from 54% (25/46) in 1975 to 8% (3/38) in 1992 in children 1-5 years (p<0.0001), reflecting the effects of single-dose treatment five years earlier. By 1992, Wb123 Ab prevalence in children 6-10 years had fallen from 75% (42/56) in 1975 to 42% (33/79) consistent with a lower cumulative transmission potential.

While several mechanisms have been implicated in mediating this T cell specific downregulation, a role for alterations in the homeostasis of T effector and memory cell populations has not been explored. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we investigated the role of persistent filarial infection on the maintenance of T cell memory in patients from the filarial-endemic Cook Islands. Compared to filarial-uninfected endemic normals (EN), microfilaria (mf) positive infected patients (Inf) had a reduced CD4 central memory (T(CM)) compartment. In addition, Inf patients tended to have more effector memory cells (T(EM)) and fewer effector cells (T(EFF)) than did ENs giving significantly smaller T(EFF):T(EM) ratios. These contracted T(CM) and T(EFF) populations were still evident in patients previously mf+ who had cleared their infection (CLInf). Moreover, the density of IL-7Ralpha, necessary for T memory cell maintenance (but decreased in T effector cells), was significantly higher on memory cells of Inf and CLInf patients, although there was no evidence for decreased IL-7 or increased soluble IL7-Ralpha, both possible mechanisms for signaling defects in memory cells. However, effector cells that were present in Inf and CLInf patients had lower percentages of HLA-DR suggesting impaired function. These changes in T cell populations appear to reflect chronicity of infection, as filarial-infected children, despite the presence of active infection, did not show alterations in the frequencies of these T cell phenotypes. These data indicate that filarial-infected patients have contracted T(CM) compartments and a defect in effector cell development, defects that persist even following clearance of infection.

Data were combined and compared using weighted mean effect estimates taking into account the longitudinal nature of the data. Combined treatment with diethylcarbamazine plus ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole, and ivermectin plus albendazole resulted in average microfilarial intensity decreases that were 0.7%, 4.6%, and 12.7% of the pre-treatment values, respectively. Drug combinations containing diethylcarbamazine were the most effective against microfilarial prevalence and intensity relative to single drugs or other combinations.

In contrast, from the 1860s to soon after the end of the Second World War, health amelioration in French Polynesia was slowly occurring. This constituted a first epidemiological transition in which infectious disease mortality was sharply reduced. The distribution of vaccines, hygiene education and legislation stemmed the long period of some 100 years of demographic disaster and at last the population was able to increase. However for a long time infectious or parasitic diseases remained the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Only from the end of the 1950s has the situation evolved to the present state where morbidity and mortality of the circulatory system and cancer are similar in prevalence to industrialized countries.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Residents of rural villages near Madang were studied prior to and one year after each of three rounds of MDA with diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole administered per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The mean MDA compliance rate was 72.9%. Three rounds of MDA decreased microfilaremia rates (Mf, 1 ml night blood by filter) from 18.6% pre-MDA to 1.3% after the third MDA (a 94% decrease). Mf clearance rates in infected persons were 71%, 90.7%, and 98.1% after 1, 2, and 3 rounds of MDA. Rates of filarial antigenemia assessed by card test (a marker for adult worm infection) decreased from 47.5% to 17.1% (a 64% decrease) after 3 rounds of MDA. The filarial antibody rate (IgG(4) antibodies to Bm14, an indicator of filarial infection status and/or exposure to mosquito-borne infective larvae) decreased from 59.3% to 25.1% (a 54.6% decrease). Mf, antigen, and antibody rates decreased more rapidly in children <11 years of age (by 100%, 84.2%, and 76.8%, respectively) relative to older individuals, perhaps reflecting their lighter infections and shorter durations of exposure/infection prior to MDA. Incidence rates for microfilaremia, filarial antigenemia, and antifilarial antibodies also decreased significantly after MDA. Filarial DNA rates in Anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes that had recently taken a blood meal decreased from 15.1% to 1.0% (a 92.3% decrease). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MDA had dramatic effects on all filariasis parameters in the study area and also reduced incidence rates.

However, on Misima Island in Milne Bay Province, government and private sectors have collaborated to implement a pilot elimination programme. Although interim evaluation indicated that the programme has been parasitologically successful, an appreciation that sustainable health gains depend on understanding and accommodating local beliefs prompted this qualitative study. METHODS: We investigated Misima community members knowledge and attitudes about lymphatic filariasis and the elimination programme. A combination of focus groups and key informant interviews were used to explore participants perceptions of health; knowledge of the aetiology and symptoms of filariasis, elephantiasis and hydrocele; attitudes towards the disease and mass drug distribution; and the social structure and decision-making protocols within the villages. RESULTS: Focus group discussions proved inferior to key informant interviews for gathering rich data. Study participants did not consider lymphatic filariasis ("pom") a major health problem but were generally positive about mass drug administration campaigns. A variety of conditions were frequently and incorrectly attributed to filariasis. Participants expressed the belief that individuals infected with filariasis always had visible manifestations of disease. A common misconception was that taking drugs during campaigns provided long-term immunity against disease. The role of mosquito vectors in transmission was not generally appreciated and certain clinical presentations, particularly hydrocele, were associated with supernatural forces. Multiple adverse events were associated with mass drug administration campaigns and most study participants mentioned community members who did not participate in campaigns.

Lymphatic filariasis Samoa 3-7 April 2008",Description:`Objectives of mission: 
In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and a COMBI expert: to provide support for the development of a \u201CCommunication for Behavioural Impact\u201D (COMBI) plan for the Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. 
Summary of activities, findings, conclusions and recommendations: 
The writer worked with a COMBI expert from WHO/HQ Mrs Asiya Odugleh-Kolev. They met with the Assistant CEO of Health, the coordinator of the LF program and the LF/MDA committee. They conducted individual interviews with young males, village mayors, household members in one low compliance/high prevalence area and one high compliance/low prevalence area. They also conducted interviews with women\u2019s representatives who were involved in tablets distribution during the previous MDA. These activities were conducted with the LF coordinator from the MOH, the WHO SSA in charge of the LF program, two staff from the MOH, one of them trained in COMBI in Fiji in 2007 but who never had an opportunity to practice and use her COMBI skills. Therefore this visit was used as an on-the-spot training on interviews and on how to gather information to develop a communication plan. Youth interviews were carried out using Top-Of-the-Mind-Analysis (TOMA) and Day-In-the-Life-Of (DILO) questionnaires and opened questions with key informants. 
On Saturday evening the data collected were entered into an Excel database, analysed and discussed by the MOH/WHO team. A powerpoint presentation highlighting the main findings and recommendations was prepared and presented to the ACEO on Sunday afternoon. A discussion followed the presentation on communication strategies needed in order to improve MDA coverage and reach the target of at least 85% of the general population ingesting the drugs. This plan (slides 25 to 33 of the power point presentation) will need to be further fed and developed by the MOH team based on additional interviews to be conducted in urban areas in particular. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Despite a low MDA coverage (below 70%) for three out of six rounds the MDA carried out since 1999 have effectively reduced antigenemia and microfilaremia prevalence to low levels. However, the target of below 1% antigenemia prevalence has not been reached and the increase of the ICT and Mf prevalence between 2004 and 2007 is a concern even if the methods used for the sampling method are not exactly the same. The fact that during the 2007 survey LF antigen and Mf has been detected in children indicating that transmission has occurred in the past five years is also of concern. Additional rounds of \u201Cimproved Mass Drug Administration\u201D will be needed starting 2008. In order to achieve a coverage of at least 85% of the total population ingesting the drugs during the next rounds of MDA a number of activities focusing on new distribution and communication strategies will be needed as per the plan discussed with the MOH on the last day of this mission. It will be of tremendous importance to get a strong social mobilisation based on the communication plans and activities developed during this mission. Specific messages will need to be developed to reach each of the target audience identified: young males, elderly, female and usually compliant people, etc 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1) A minimum of two additional rounds of \u201Cimproved MDA\u201D should be implemented starting in 2008 with a targeted coverage of at least 85% of the general population AND at least 85% of the male group. The distribution strategy should be a directly observed treatment. A special attention should be paid to the previously \u201Ctoo old\u201D and \u201Ctoo sick\u201D categories and a specific strategy developed for this particular group. 
2) The strong leadership and new directions taken by the Ministry of Health demonstrate a high commitment and all efforts should be made to support the new strategy and the focused distribution in three days. The important shift from a long timeframe to a short time frame distribution, from a passive attitude to an active behaviour from the communities, from a non DOT to a DOT strategy will need a well organiosed and comprehensive communication plan. 
3) The breakdown of the budget needed for this MDA should be urgently finalised to approach donors and partners. 
4) The communication strategy discussed during this mission and presented to the MOH on the last day of this visit (attached powerpoint presentation) should be further developed and implemented. It will be of tremendous importance to mobilise and get strong support from all sectors, leaders and media if the target is going to be met.`,Year:"2008",Authors:"Capuano, C.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"48","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1139",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"Mission Report.

GPELF has expanded its mass drug administration (MDA) coverage with the recommended two-drug co-administration from a modest 3 million people in 12 countries in 2000 to more than 70 million in 36 countries during 2003. In addition, as part of an ongoing programme, India has covered an additional number of people with diethylcar-bamazine citrate (DEC) alone. In 2002, the population in the implementation units (IUs) covered exceeded the anticipated targets that were laid down in GPELF\u2019s strategic plan developed in 1999. Encouraged by this rapid expansion, the partners of the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) set the target for MDA coverage at 350 million people in 2005. Subsequently, a strategic plan for scaling up to achieve the target was developed in 2003 in consultation with partners, including the endemic countries. This strategic plan covering the period 2003\u20132005 was approved by TAG-LF. To ensure that this target is realistic, however, and to assess the resource requirements, each endemic country with an active programme was requested to provide a forecast of scaling up of MDA for the period 2004\u20132008.

Lymphatic filariasis continues to be the major cause of disability in the world, and approximately 120 million people are infected. The disease is endemic in 80 countries and territories, 32 of which have implemented active elimination programmes \u2013 10 more than in 2001. Nevertheless, the challenge remains considerable: although these 32 countries and territories represent almost 80% of the global at-risk population, they have covered only 5% of their own at-risk population with mass drug administration (MDA). Despite this, progress is encouraging since these countries reported a satisfactory drug coverage rate that established a promising foundation for future scaling-up of the elimination programmes.There is an urgent need to inject more energy into advocacy and fundraising: capacity building is a crucial component of the Global Programme and requires continuous enhancement.

There are more than a billion people who are at risk of lymphatic filariasis, which is not a killer disease. The infection is caused by thread- like worms (filariae) which lodge in the lymphatic system, producing millions of minute larvae (microfilariae) that circulate in the blood. Although infection often occurs in childhood, the symptoms are commonly delayed until adulthood. Over 120 million people are currently living with the disease, including about 40 million who are incapacitated and disfigured by it. Of all diseases, lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability. Until recently, the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis depended on night blood examinations to detect microfilariae. Now, there is an antigen-detection test that can be taken at any time of the day, making it feasible to map the disease geographically. Drugs, which are available free or at low cost, kill the microfilariae in the blood. Simple methods of hygiene and self-care can reduce the effects of the disease. With such effective tools to hand, the Fiftieth World Health Assembly, in 1997, resolved to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. This report discusses the progress so far.",Year:"2001",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"81","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_1154_WHO_GLOBAL_PROGRAMME_TO_ELIMINATE_LYMPHATIC_FILARIASIS_Annual_Report_on_Lymphatic_filariasis_2001.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"1155",Category:"Annual Reports",Title:"Year in Review 2006",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2006",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"33","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1156",Category:"Annual Reports",Title:"Annual Report 2010",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2010",Authors:"The Task Force for Global Health",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"29","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1157",Category:"Annual Reports",Title:"Collaborate and Innovate to Transform Global Health -

In 1997 the World Health Assembly endorsed efforts to eliminate transmission of filariasis on a country by country basis (WHA resolution 50.29). Filariasis is a disease which is endemic in communities worldwide affecting an estimated 120 million persons. Table 1 lists those countries where human filariasis has been: (i) endemic during the 1980s and 1990s, (ii) endemic or possibly endemic before 1980 but not recognized since then, (iii) sporadically reported without evidence of endemic disease. In 1998, there is still lack of knowledge about when transmission of filariasis was interrupted in many countries. The need for certification of attainment is inherent in the goal of an elimination programme; such a need does not exist for control programmes. There must be an objective basis, according to agreed criteria, for determining whether transmission of filariasis has indeed been eliminated; the criteria must take into account the risk of importation from filariasis endemic countries. It is expected that efforts towards elimination of filariasis transmission for individual countries will be conducted until the global certification of elimination of filariasis is achieved. In order to complete the process of certifying elimination, an independent International Commission for the Certification of Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination (ICCLFE) will be established by World Health Organization (WHO). This commission will recommend to the Organization those countries that fulfil the requirements for certification, as well as advise the Organization on criteria, procedures and progress made towards elimination of filariasis transmission. The commission will also designate a panel of specialists, whose members can be assigned to International Certification Teams (ICTs). WHO, including the Regional offices, will facilitate national preparations for certification by carrying out regular visits by WHO staff, members of the designated ICT, or consultants to the country or sub-region concerned. A register will be established of countries requesting certification and also of those countries where official certification of elimination is pending. Finally WHO will also establish an official register of countries where filariasis has been eliminated, ba5ed on evaluations by the ICCLFE. The aim of the present document is to describe the criteria for verifying the absence of filariasis transmission. In addition WHO has developed a document addressing issues of disease ascertainment, monitoring, and pre-elimination surveillance - i.e., addressing the various issues before elimination certification (see document WHO/FIL/99.195).",Year:"1998",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"20","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_1213_WHO_1998_Guidelines_for_Certifying_Lymphatic_Filariasis_Elimination.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"1214",Category:"Guidelines and Instructional Materials",Title:"Space Spray Application of Insecticides for Vector and Public Health Pest Control",Description:"A practitioner's guide",Year:"2003",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"43","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1215",Category:"Guidelines and Instructional Materials",Title:"Lymphatic filariasis: A handbook of practical entomology = Filariose lympatique: entomologie practique",Description:"Overview: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis has scaled up its activities more rapidly than almost any other global public health programme. By the end of 2011, 53 of 73 endemic countries were implementing mass drug administration, and more than 3.9 billion treatments had been delivered to 952 million people. Challenges remain, however, in meeting the goal of eliminating the disease. Vector control is a possible complementary strategy in countries or areas (i) where mass drug administration has not started, such as those where loiasis is co-endemic; (ii) where the burden of lymphatic filariasis is heaviest and mass drug administration must be rapidly scaled up or (iii) where the expected impact of mass drug administration has not been achieved; and where local transmission has been interrupted to prevent recurrence. This document explains why vector control is important in national programmes and describes the preparation of a tailor-made control plan for national programmes. It outlines entomological procedures for regular and specific vector control and how data should be analysed for better overall understanding of filarial transmission and vectors. The document will also be useful for teaching personnel in lymphatic filariasis programmes about the use and value of entomological procedures in overall epidemiological appraisal in the context of elimination.

Eleven persons remained microfilaremic, whereas 18 had cleared both microfilaremia and antigenemia. Despite decreased infection on the island, antibody levels remained relatively constant for the subjects with persistent microfilaremia (Mf+/+), in contrast to sharp decreases for both EN subjects and subjects with cleared microfilaremia (Mf+/-). Although clinically indistinguishable from the EN subjects, the Mf+/- group had antibody levels (IgG, IgG4, and IgE) significantly lower than those of the EN subjects. Lymphocyte responses to parasite antigens were marginally greater in Mf+/- than in Mf+/+ subjects, but both groups remained less cell responsive (as measured by proliferation, interleukin-5, interleukin-10, interferon-\u03B3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) than did the EN subjects. These findings suggest that, for microfilaremic persons, complete clearance of infection is not sufficient to restore "normal" immune responsiveness; filarial infection may induce very long-term deficits in the ability to respond to parasite antigens',Year:"2001",Authors:"Steel, C., Ottesen, E.A.",Journal:"Journal of Infectious Diseases",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"184(1)",Pages:"73-79","Work Location":["Cook Islands"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/321004",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"1225",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Lymphatic filariasis elimination: Progress in global programme development",Description:"The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) is an innovative, public-private partnership for health improvement. The progress made since the programme was initiated, in 1998, is here reviewed. The programme is largely based on the regular mass administration of albendazole with either ivermectin (Mectizan\xAE) or diethylcarbamazine. Both albendazole and ivermectin have been donated by their manufacturers, for as long as necessary. The first national campaigns based on these drugs commenced in late 1999. Since then, rapid progress has been made in confirming the safety of the drug combinations, establishing a regional approach, and recognizing that experiences, epidemiological settings, health systems, the best drug combinations and disease burdens all vary with the country involved. There is a continuing trend towards decentralization, and this should lead to greater regional and national ownership and more inter-country activities. The progress made in mapping the geographical distribution of lymphatic filariasis (LF), by designated implementation units and, ultimately, by country, is also summarized. Country-specific methods of social mobilization and drug distribution, that are compatible with health planning at central and district level, need to be developed. However, the assessment of coverage by mass drug administration (MDA) needs to be strengthened, to allow reliable national monitoring and inter-country or inter-region comparisons. Valuable contributions made by non-governmental development organizations (NGDO) and civil society organizations (CSO) are acknowledged, such organizations (and particularly local NGDO) should be encouraged to help more in implementing the various activities at district level. The GPELF has developed during an era of considerable change in international health policy. The programme can contribute to the relief of poverty, as LF is closely associated with low-income communities in the least developed countries and MDA is a pro-poor intervention. There are clear opportunities for linking the activities of the GPELF (which uses cheap or free drugs that bring considerable incidental health benefits, in addition to arresting the transmission of the parasites causing LF) with other health interventions. New evidence indicates that annual treatments with antifilarial drugs greatly reduce the clinical abnormalities of the disease. The programme has expanded rapidly, with the annual number of people treated rising from 2.9 million (in 12 countries) in the year 2000 to 25.89 million (in 22 countries) in 2001 and an estimated 80 million (in 34 countries) in 2002. At the recent meeting of the Global Alliance, held in New Delhi in May 2002, a significant but realistic challenge - of scaling-up the programme to cover up to 350 million of those at risk, by the end of 2005 - was set. The rate of growth necessary to meet this target presents considerable strategic and managerial challenges to all of the partners involved in the programme, from the development of synergies with other, large-scale, public-health interventions to the logistics of drug manufacture, shipping and local transportation and resolving the problems of social mobilization, reporting, evaluation and monitoring on such a scale. Such challenges are, however, easily outweighed by the potential benefits of success. If the international health community cannot provide the necessary support to complement the investments being made by the endemic countries (as they scale-up their LF-elimination campaigns and ensure yearly access to two free and efficacious drugs that bring major benefits to those treated), significant progress in the control of other infectious diseases becomes a very distant goal.",Year:"2002",Authors:"Molyneux, D.H., Zagaria, N.",Journal:"Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"96 (SUPPL. 2)",Pages:"S15-S40","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_1225_Molyneux_and_Zagaria_2002_ATMP_Lymphatic_filariasis_elimination_progress_in_global_programme_development.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"1226",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Impact of Mass Drug Administration On Aedes-transmitted filariasis In the Pacific",Description:"Working paper for the Scientific Working Group meeting on Lymphatic Filariasis Research, TDR, Geneva 10-12 May 2005",Year:"2005",Authors:"Burkot, T.R., Melrose, W.D., Durrheim, D.N., Speare, R., Ichimori, K.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"10","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1228",Category:"Action/Strategic Plans",Title:"Plan of Action for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis in the Western Pacific Region",Description:"Plan by country with budgets",Year:"2009",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"8","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1229",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"The argument for integrating vector control with multiple drug administration campaigns to ensure elimination of lymphatic filariasis",Description:"Background: There is a danger that mass drug administration campaigns may fail to maintain adequate treatment coverage to achieve lymphatic filariasis elimination. Hence, additional measures to suppress transmission might be needed to ensure the success of the Global Program for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis. Discussion: Vector control successfully eliminated lymphatic filariasis when implemented alone or with mass drug administration. Challenges to lymphatic filariasis elimination include uncertainty of the exact level and duration of microfilarial suppression required for elimination, the mobility of infected individuals, consistent non-participation of some infected individuals with mass drug administration, the possible development of anti-filarial drug resistance and treatment strategies in areas co-endemic with loasis. Integration of vector control with mass drug administration can address some of these challenges. The potential benefits of vector control would include: (1) the ability to suppress filariasis transmission without the need to identify all individual 'foci of infection'; (2) minimizing the risk of reestablishment of transmission from imported microfilaria positive individuals; and (3) decreasing the risk of dengue or malaria transmission where, respectively, Aedes or Anopheles are lymphatic filariasis vectors. Summary: With adequate sustained treatment coverage, mass drug administration should meet the criteria for elimination of lymphatic filariasis. However, it may be difficult to sustain sufficiently high mass drug administration coverage to achieve lymphatic filariasis elimination in some areas, particularly, where Aedes species are the vectors. Since vector control was effective in controlling and even eliminating lymphatic filariasis transmission, integration of vector control with mass drug administration will ensure the sustainability of transmission suppression and thereby, better ensure the success of national filariasis elimination programs. Although trials of some vector control interventions are needed, proven vector control strategies are ready for immediate integration with mass drug administration for many important vectors. Vector control is the only presently available additional lymphatic filariasis control measure with the potential for immediate implementation.",Year:"2006",Authors:"Burkot, T.R., Durrheim, D.N., Melrose, W.D., Speare, R., Ichimori, K.",Journal:"Filaria Journal",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"5(10)",Pages:"7","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_1229_Burkot_et_al_2006_FILARIA_J_The_argument_for_integrating_vector_control_1475-2883-5-10.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"1230",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Parasitology Today Tick-Host Immunology",Description:"The ICT filariasis test.

The present study was carried out to assess the status of oxidative stress in different clinical presentations of bancroftian filariasis. Twenty-five microfilariae carriers and 30 cases each of chronic filariasis and occult filariasis were compared to 30 endemic normal individuals. Serum malondialdehyde level and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity were measured by spectrophotometric methods and levels of filarial antigen were measured by ELISA. In the filarial cases, the levels of these parameters were assayed again after treatment with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC). Results showed significant (P < 0.05) association of oxidative stress with chronic and occult filariasis but not with microfilarial carriers.

The public health importance of lymphatic filariasis has generated a large body of research in this area, both in laboratory studies (Ottesen, 1984,1989; Maizels & Lawrence, 1991) and in the field (Hayashi, 1962; Hairston & Jachowski, 1968; Denham & McGreevy, 1977; Vanamail et al. 1989 b; Bundy, Grenfell & Rajagopalan, 1991; Srividya et al. 1991 b). Despite this, there is still no conclusive explanation for the apparently complex relationship between infection and clinical disease observed in human communities. At least part of the problem may lie in the current impossibility of measuring adult worm burden in vivo (Pichon et al. 1980; Denham & Fletcher, 1987; Das et al. 1990; Grenfell et al.1990). Although there has recently been significant progress in the development of immuno logical markers for infection status in humans (Ottesen, 1989; Day et al. 1991 a), microfilaraemia is still the most reliable measure of current infection in the field. Studies in endemic areas indicate that, far from there being any simple direct relationship between microfilaraemia and disease status, it is possible to find some individuals with microfilariae in their blood but no disease, and indeed with all other combinations of infection and disease status (Hairston & de-Meillon, 1968; Hairston & Jachowski, 1968; Beaver, 1970; Bryan & Southgate, 1976; Denham & McGreevy, 1977; Pani et al. 1991).

In principle, assays based on recombinant filarial antigens should address these limitations and provide useful tools for diagnosis and surveillance of LF. The present multicenter study was designed to compare the performance of antibody assays for filariasis based on recombinant antigens Bm14, WbSXP, and BmR1. Coded serum specimens were distributed to five participating laboratories where assays for each antigen were conducted in parallel.

The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, launched following World Health Assembly Resolution 50.29 (WHA 50.29), has been facilitated in its progress by new research findings, drug donations, the availability of diagnostic tools, disability management strategies to help those already suffering and the development of partnerships. The strategy recommended by the World Health Organization of annual treatment with a two-drug combination has proved safe. Discussion. Using different approaches in several countries the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) has been demonstrated to be feasible during earlier decades. These successes have been largely overlooked. However, the programme progress since 2000 has been remarkable \u2013 upscaling rapidly from 2 million treatments in 2000 to approximately 60 million in 2002. Around 34 countries had active programmes at the end of 2002. It is anticipated that there will be further expansion \u2013 but this will be dependent on additional resources becoming available. The programme also provides significant opportunities for other disease control programmes to deliver public health benefits on a large scale. Few public health programmes have upscaled so rapidly and so cost-effectively (<$0.03/treatment in some Asian settings) \u2013 one country treating 9\u201310 million people in a day (Sri Lanka). The LF programme is arguably the most effective pro-poor public health programme currently operating which is based on country commitment and partnerships supported by a global programme and alliance. Tables are provided to summarize programme characteristics, the benefits of LF elimination, opportunities for integration with other programmes and relevance to the Millennium Development Goals. Summary. Lymphatic filariasis elimination is an "easy-to-do" inexpensive health intervention that provides considerable "beyond filariasis" benefits, exemplifies partnership and is easily evaluated. The success in global health action documented in this paper requires and deserves further support to bring to fruition elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem and health benefits to poor people. A future free of lymphatic filariasis will reduce poverty and bring better health to poor people, prevent disability, strengthen health systems and build partnerships.',Year:"2003",Authors:"Molyneux, D.",Journal:"Filaria Journal",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"2",Pages:"13","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_1257_Molyneux_2003_FIL_J_1475-2883-2-13.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"1258",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:'REPRINT "Only 0.6% of overseas development assistance for health is allocated to neglected tropical diseases, despite such diseases affecting at least 1 billion people"',Description:"A collection of 7 papers on Neglected Tropical Diseases",Year:"2010",Authors:"World Health Organisation",Journal:"The Lancet",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"375",Pages:"247","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1261",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Pacific collaboration to eliminate lymphatic filariasis",Description:"A regional programme to combat lymphatic filariasis in the Pacific islands is showing great promise as it reaches its halfway point.

Previous control efforts including sporadic mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns have reduced the prevalence to low levels but have not succeeded in eliminating the disease. To effectively plan, model and evaluate the worldwide elimination effort, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPFLF) needs data on filariasis epidemiology (including age and sex-specific prevalence and the density of microfilariae (Mf)) and estimates of the number of years of MDA required for elimination. The five-year nationwide MDA campaign carried out in Samoa before the start of the Pacific Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PacELF) generated extensive data on these issues. Methodology\u2044Principal Findings: MDA campaigns were conducted in Samoa with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in 1993 to 1995 and DEC plus ivermectin in 1996 to 1997 for all persons aged 2 years and above. Coverage of the MDA, as assessed from the campaign village register books, ranged from 62% to 97% depending on the year, and was over 80% in three out of five years. Village based surveys showed that prevalence of Mf declined from 4.3% in 1993 (N=10,256) to 1.1% in 1998 (N=4,054) (P\u03C72=94.4, p<0.001). Males had a three- to five-fold higher prevalence than females, and this difference remained consistent over the five-year period. Transmission was still occurring over the period as shown by the occurrence of new infections in 3 children less than 5 years old out of 5,691 tested (five-year cumulative incidence of 0.53 per thousand children for the period 1993 to 1998). There was a statistically significant reduction in the geometric mean number of Mf per 60 \u03BCl in positive cases between 1993 (11.8) and 1998 (6.9) (t=2.61; p<0.01). The proportion of people with a high density of Mf - over 60 Mf per 60 \u03BCl (1000 per ml) - declined from to 19.4% to 4.0% (P\u03C72=5.6, p=0.018). Conclusions\u2044Significance: Five years of sustained MDA with DEC (3 years) and DEC plus ivermectin (2 years) reduced the prevalence of Mf of W.bancrofti in Samoa by 74%. Density of Mf in infected individuals was also significantly reduced. Males had a three to five-fold higher prevalence than women. New infections in children less than five years old still occurred at a low level, suggesting that transmission was not completely interrupted. These findings helped to prepare a sound monitoring and evaluation plan for PacELF.",Year:"2007",Authors:"Ichimori, K., Tupuimalagi-Toelupe, P., Toeaso Iosia, V., Graves, P.M.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"35(3)",Pages:"261-269","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"http://doi.org/10.2149/tmh.35.261",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"1266",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"WHO position statement on integrated vector management to control malaria and lymphatic filariasis",Description:"This issue includes the WHO position statement on integrated vector management to control malaria and lymphatic filariasis",Year:"2011",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"Weekly Epidemiological Record",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"86(13)",Pages:"113-128","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_1266_WHO_2011_WER_WHO_position_statement_on_integrated_vector_management_to_control_malaria_and_lymphatic_filariasis.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"1267",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"Annex 1 to Mission report of Buck (PacELF_1332) vector density and infection rate at many villages in Western Samoa 1966-1970 and 1972-1975",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1975",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"23","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1268",Category:"Books",Title:"Basic lymphoedema management",Description:"Treatment and prevention of problems associated with lymphatic filariasis",Year:"2002",Authors:"Dreyer, G., Addiss, D., Dreyer, P.,  Nor\xF5es, J.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"112","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1269",Category:"Guidelines and Instructional Materials",Title:"Monitoring and epidemiological assessment of mass drug administration in the global program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis: a manual for national elimination programmes.",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2011",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"71","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1270",Category:"Books",Title:"Lymphatic filariasis: managing morbidity and preventing disability: an aide-m\xE9moire for national programme managers",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2013",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"53","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1271",Category:"Books",Title:"Operational Manual On The Application Of Insecticides For Control Of The Mosquito Vectors Of Malaria And Other Diseases.",Description:"Division of Control of Tropical Diseases",Year:"1997",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"196","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1272",Category:"Guidelines and Instructional Materials",Title:"Standard Operating Procedures for Stopping MDA and Post-MDA Surveillance Surveys",Description:"Gates Foundation Phase 2 studies",Year:"2009",Authors:"Kyelem, D., Won, K., Laney, S.J., Chu, B.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"29","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1274",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"Meeting of the Ministers of Health for the Pacific Island countries.

The meeting was opened by Dr H. Endo, Director, Department of Control, Prevention, and Eradication (CPE) of the Communicable Diseases Cluster. Dr Endo welcomed all the participants and thanked TAG-ELF members for contributing their time and expertise. He pointed out that the meeting was particularly critical because of the financial crisis affecting WHO and the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF). The meeting was attended by all 14 members of TAG-ELF. Other participants were members of the WHO Secretariat, staff of the WHO Regional Offices for Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific, technical experts to advise TAG-ELF on specific issues, and observers from the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF). Dr K.Y. Dadzie continued to serve as Chairman and Dr D. Addiss was appointed Rapporteur. Dr Dadzie welcomed the participants and introduced two new TAG-ELF members- Professor Dato Dr C.P. Ramachandran (Malaysia) and Dr Addiss (USA). A full list of participants is given in Annex 1. Dr Dadzie suggested minor rescheduling of the agenda. Dr Ramachandran moved to accept the revised agenda and this was seconded by Dr R. Henderson. The agenda adopted is given in Annex 2. Dr Henderson pointed out that the fmancial crisis affecting WHO was also felt by the filariasis elimination programmes at country level, and suggested that "packaging" lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination with programmes for the control of other parasitic diseases, such as intestinal helminths, might have advantages. Dr Dadzie agreed and indicated that this issue would be addressed on the agenda.',Year:"2004",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"38","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1296",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Report on Lymphatic filariasis Scientific Working Group",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2005",Authors:"WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR)",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"NO VALUE","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["Japanese"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1298",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 60th Annual Meeting Program",Description:"December 4-8, 2011, Philadelphia Marriott Downtown",Year:"2011",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"85(6)",Pages:"303","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1299",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"Report from Informal Consultation on Albendazole Research",Description:"Report from Informal Consultation on Albendazole Research.

In this changing landscape, national programmes for the control of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases must be reinforced and adapted for three reasons: the global burden of these communicable diseases remains enormous, disease control programmes have an integral and supporting role in developing health systems, and the health benefits of these control programmes go beyond the containment of specific infections. WHO's traditional role in promoting communicable disease control programmes must also adapt to new circumstances.

capacity of programmes, partnerships and intersectoral collaboration in their efforts to control vector-borne diseases.1 IVM is a system of rational decision-making developed to optimize the use of resources for vector control (Box 1). The IVM approach aims to contribute to achieving the global targets set for vector-borne disease control by making vector control more efficacious, cost-effective, ecologically sound and sustainable. This document addresses the use of IVM for two of the most important vector-borne diseases: malaria and lymphatic filariasis. The IVM approach is useful and appropriate for jointly managing control activities against malaria and lymphatic filariasis in terms of planning, implementation and monitoring, particularly in areas where both infections are transmitted by the same species of mosquito vectors. IVM may concurrently reduce the incidence of both diseases so that control efforts have synergistic effects.

The disease has been targeted for global elimination by 2020. Transmission control and disability alleviation are the two pillars of the elimination strategy under the Global Programme for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF). Interruption of transmission is being achieved by mass annual administration of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or ivermectin to entire communities at risk of infection. When community drug consumption rates are adequate, this is expected to result in reduction of transmission of lymphatic filariasis to low levels, and ultimately in elimination of filariasis, preventing new infections from occurring and protecting future generations from the disease. Recognizing the physical suffering, gross disfigurement and consequent socioeconomic impact due to lymphoedema (particularly limbs), and the fact that simple foot hygiene can result in prevention of repeated attacks of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL) and progression of lymphoedema, efforts are being taken to teach patients and their families skin care and simple measures of hygiene. It is realized that a disability alleviation strategy needs to be evolved for lymphatic filariasis patients who suffer from several urogenital manifestations, the burden of which is larger than that due to lymphoedema of limbs. In view of this, the WHO unit for Strategy Development and Monitoring for Eradication and Elimination (CEE) called for an informal consultation meeting of surgeons to address the issue of surgical management of urogenital manifestations of filariasis.",Year:"2002",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"WHO/CDS/CPE/CEE/2002.33",Pages:"34","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English","French"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_1448_Surgical_approaches_to_the_urogenital_manifestations_of_lymphatic_filariasis.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"1450",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"Safe Use of Pesticides",Description:"Fourteenth Report of the WHO Expert Committee on Vector Biology and Control",Year:"1991",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"27","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1451",Category:"Books",Title:"Safety of Pyrethroids for Public Health Use",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2005",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"69","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1452",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Interim Specifications for Pesticides used in Public Health",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1998",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"59","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1453",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Interim Specifications for Pesticides used in Public Health",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1997",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"54","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1454",Category:"Guidelines and Instructional Materials",Title:"Alere TM filariasis Test Strip",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2013",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"2","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1455",Category:"Books",Title:"Filariasis and elephantiasis in Fiji: being a report to the London School of Tropical Medicine",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1912",Authors:"Bahr, P.H.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"192","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_1455_Manson-Bahr_1912__FIlariasis_and_elephantiasis_in_Fiji__LSHTM_b21356658.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"1456",Category:"Books",Title:"Brighter futures without lymphatic filariasis",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2002",Authors:"WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"18","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1458",Category:"Guidelines and Instructional Materials",Title:"Vector-borne disease handbook for health workers in Vanuatu",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2001",Authors:"Amos, M., Graves, P., Tabi-Rap, G.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"Edition 1",Pages:"35","Work Location":["Vanuatu"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1459",Category:"Books",Title:"Health in Asia and Pacific",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2008",Authors:"WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific and Regional Office for South-East Asia",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"539","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1460",Category:"Guidelines and Instructional Materials",Title:"Monitoring and epidemiological assessment of the programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis at implementation level",Description:"Overview: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis was launched in 2000 and since then has expanded its mass drug administration coverage with the recommended two-drug co-administration from 3 million people in 12 countries in 2000 to more than 70 million people in 36 countries in 2003. Throughout this period, the need for standardized guidelines on monitoring and epidemiological assessment of the Programme at implementation unit level has become increasingly evident because this is the level at which the core programmatic operations are conducted. These guidelines are based on current knowledge and understanding of the epidemiological aspects of the disease. However, in view of the rapid involvement of both scientific advances and experience in implementation of national elimination programmes, adaptation of the guidelines might be required to address particular circumstances. In light of the diverse responsibilities of the health personnel in charge of lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes, the authors have developed guidelines that are as concise as possible.

Blood samples were collected simultaneously every 4 hours during a 48 hour period by finger-prick and venipuncture for determination of microfilaremia by both blood film and membrane filtration technique methods, and for determination of antigenemia. The membrane filtration results showed no significant nycthemeral variations between the microfilaria densities at hours 16:00, 20: 00, 24:00, 04:00, 08:00 and 12:00. Conversely, the blood film method showed a significant difference between the microfilaria densities: the microfilaremia was higher during the day (12:00-20:00 hours) than during the night (24:00-08:00 hours). As for antigenemia, using Og 4 C3 monoclonal antibody, there was no significant fluctuation during 48 hours. These results confirm that W bancrofti var. pacifica is subperiodic and diurnal in French Polynesia.

Elephantiasis, lymphoedema, and genital pathology afflict 44 million men, women and children; another 76 million have parasites in their blood and hidden internal damage to their lymphatic and renal systems. In the past, tools and strategies for the control of the condition were inadequate, but over the last 10 years dramatic research advances have led to new understanding about the severity and impact of the disease, new diagnostic and monitoring tools, and, most importantly, new treatment tools and control strategies. The new strategy aims both at transmission control through community-wide (mass) treatment programmes and at disease control through individual patient management. Annual single-dose coadministration of two drugs (ivermectin + diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or albendazole) reduces blood microfilariae by 99% for a full year; even a single dose of one drug (ivermectin or DEC) administered annually can result in 90% reductions; field studies confirm that such reduction of microfilarial loads and prevalence can interrupt transmission. New approaches to disease control, based on preventing bacterial superinfection, can now halt or even reverse the lymphoedema and elephantiasis sequelae of filarial infection. Recognizing these remarkable technical advances, the successes of recent control programmes, and the biological factors favouring elimination of this infection, the Fiftieth World Health Assembly recently called on WHO and its Member States to establish as a priority the global elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem.",Year:"1997",Authors:"Ottesen, E.A., Duke, B.O.L., Karam, M., Behbehani, K.",Journal:"Bulletin of the World Health Organization",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"75(6)",Pages:"491-503","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_1592_Ottesen_et_al_1997_Strategies_and_tools_for_the_control_elimination_of_lymphatic_filariasis.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"1593",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"Microfilaria periodicity study in Kiribati and Fiji",Description:"WHO APW Place visited Fiji 27 June to 31 Dec 2001.

The overall prevalence rate was 4.5% by the NP method and 3.8% by the FP method. The average microfilarial prevalence in males was 2.3 times higher than in females, and the rate among males aged 30 years and over was as high as 20%. The positive cases were found to be concentrated in certain households. The median microfilarial density (MfD-50) for the whole of Samoa was 18.6 using 60-mm3 blkood samples (males, 21.4; females 14.2). While the MfD-50 of any village has a positive association with the microfilarial prevalence rate of that village, a relatively high MfD-50 was noticed among young people under 20 years of age together with low prevalence rates. The negative binomial distribution was fitted to the data on the distribution of microfilarial counts in Samoa and gave a better fit than the log-normal distribution.

Development of an easy-touse, rapid-format diagnostic tool has facilitated precise location of infectious zones thus allowing quick intervention. Two new drugs, i.e., ivermectin and albendazole, have been shown to be highly effective in the management of microfilariasis due to Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori thus greatly expanding a therapeutic arsenal once limited to diethylcarbamazine. The current eradication strategy is designed to break the chain of transmission in populations exposed to the risk of infection by administering a single dose of two drugs yearly for five to six years. Combined treatment using albendazole plus ivermectin or albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine has resulted in near-zero microfilaremia levels for at least one year. Based on these new developments, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution calling on member states to work for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem.

Antigenemia was determined in 1322 persons by means of the Og4C3 antibody capture assay. Prevalence of antigenemia by village ranged from 61.7% to 98.2% and did not vary by sex. Antigen level increased with transmission potential among the 4 villages with measured transmission potential (r(2)=.945; P=.028). Antigenemia was associated positively with age in villages with the lowest annual transmission potentials (45 and 404 infective larvae/year; P<.001), but was distributed evenly across age groups in villages with increased transmission (1485 and 2518 infective larvae/year).

Working Version: September 1999. Overview: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring disease that has a major social and economic impact in Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific and parts of the Americas. Until recently, little could be done to relieve the suffering and disability caused by this disease. Today, however, significant advances have been made in understanding both the disease and its control. A global coalition has been forged among many organizations, each with a different mandate but all having a common goal: to tackle the wide-ranging and complex process of science and practice that will result in the elimination of LF as a public health problem1 from the world. A strong start was made in 1997 when the World Health Assembly passed a resolution calling for ' ... the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem ... '. Following this, WHO, with support from organizations including donor countries, the World Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began developing a coalition to eliminate the disease. The following year the coalition was given a powerful boost when SmithKiine Beech am announced its commitment to form a unique private-sector/public-sector collaboration with WHO to support the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. The two organizations pledged to work together closely to undertake this massive international public health effort. Subsequently, Merck & Co., Inc. pledged to expand its ongoing Mectizan\xAE Donation Program for onchocerciasis to cover treatment of lymphatic filariasis in all African countries where the two diseases occur together. Individually, none of these organizations can eliminate LF; but by working together, and working through the Ministries of Health in the endemic countries, we believe that it can be done. Not all partners will work in each country, but, together, we hope to develop partnerships that will cover all of the affected countries and ensure an extraordinarily positive impact on many millions of lives.",Year:"1999",Authors:"WHO Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination (CPE/CEE/FIL) Control Prevention and Eradication",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"64","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1739",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"REPORT ON THE 2ND VISIT TO THE COOK ISLANDS: 11APRIL TO 2 MAY 1993",Description:"11 April to 2 May 1993",Year:"1993",Authors:"Ichimori, K.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"19","Work Location":["Cook Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1740",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"REPORT ON THE 3RD VISIT TO THE COOK ISLANDS 13 AUGUST - 4TH SEPTEMBER 1993",Description:"13 Aug 5o 4 Sep 1993",Year:"1993",Authors:"Ichimori, K.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"14","Work Location":["Cook Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1741",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"Recent developments in the integrated control of tropical diseases",Description:"SEAR/WPR Biregional meeting on prevention and control of selected parasitic diseases: Manila, Phillipines 13-15 April 1998",Year:"1998",Authors:"Savioli, L.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"WPR/CTD/MAL/(1)98.2",Pages:"4","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1742",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"REPORT ON THE 4TH VISIT TO THE COOK ISLANDS 10 OCTOBER - 28 OCTOBER 1993",Description:"10 Oct to 28 Oct 1993",Year:"1993",Authors:"Ichimori, K.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"8","Work Location":["Cook Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1743",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"REPORT IN THE 1ST VISIT TO THE COOK ISLANDS: 27 SEPTEMBER TO 9 OCTOBER 1992",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1992",Authors:"Ichimori, K.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"10","Work Location":["Cook Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1744",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Simple sample size calculation for cluster-randomized trials",Description:"BACKGROUND: Cluster-randomized trials, in which health interventions are allocated randomly to intact clusters or communities rather than to individual subjects, are increasingly being used to evaluate disease control strategies both in industrialized and in developing countries. Sample size computations for such trials need to take into account between-cluster variation, but field epidemiologists find it difficult to obtain simple guidance on such procedures. METHODS: In this paper, we provide simple formulae for sample size determination for both unmatched and pair-matched trials. Outcomes considered include rates per person-year, proportions and means. For simplicity, formulae are expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation (SD/mean) of cluster rates, proportions or means. Guidance is also given on the estimation of this value, with or without the use of prior data on between-cluster variation. CASE STUDIES: The methods are illustrated using two case studies: an unmatched trial of the impact of impregnated bednets on child mortality in Kenya, and a pair-matched trial of improved sexually-transmitted disease (STD) treatment services for HIV prevention in Tanzania.",Year:"1999",Authors:"Hayes, R.J., Bennett, S.",Journal:"International Journal of Epidemiology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"28",Pages:"319-326","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ije/28.2.319",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"1745",Category:"Drafts",Title:'COOK ISLANDS MOSQUITO CONTROL PROGRAMME-----"STOP AEDES AEGYPTI !!!"-----',Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"NO VALUE",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"5","Work Location":["Cook Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1746",Category:"Drafts",Title:"COOK ISLANDS MOSQUITO / SANDFLY CONTROL PROGRAMME AITUTAKI",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"NO VALUE",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"5","Work Location":["Cook Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1747",Category:"Drafts",Title:"REPORT OF THE 5TH VISIT TO THE COOK ISLANDS 11 FEBRUARY 5 MARCH 1994",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1994",Authors:"Ichimori, K.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"8","Work Location":["Cook Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1748",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"REPORT ON MOSQUITOES OF RAROTONGA, COOK ISLANDS PART 2.

The advantage of the assay is that the biotinylated PCR product is visualized following hybridization with specific probes which are immobilized on plate wells (microtiter plate hybridization). This method has been previously evaluated in a field study and was found to be sensitive and specific for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. In the current study, the microtiter plate hybridization PCR method was evaluated by using blood specimens from malaria patients. All of 36 cases of falciparum malaria, 26 of 27 cases of vivax malaria, all of 11 cases of ovale malaria, and 2 cases of malariae malaria were diagnosed species specifically by the PCR method. There were four smear-negative, PCR-positive cases that seemed to correspond to the convalescent stage of malaria. In contrast, 30 cases for which the diagnosis of malaria has been excluded on the basis of microscopy and clinical courses showed negative PCR results. By comparing parasite densities and PCR results following antimalarial treatment of some patients, it was revealed that the PCR results largely paralleled the parasite densities and that PCR could detect as few as 10 parasites per microliter of blood. We conclude that this PCR method is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of all four parasite species and can serve as a useful supplement to microscopy for the clinical management of malaria.",Year:"1995",Authors:"Kimura, M., Miyake, H., Kim, H.S., Tanabe, M., Arai, M., Kawai, S., Yamane, A., Wataya, Y.",Journal:"Journal of Clinical Microbiology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"33(9)",Pages:"2342-2346","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1815",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"Development and validation of sampling strategies for xenomonitoring of infection in Culex vector by PCR as a surveillance tool for assessing post-MDA situation of Lymphatic filariasis elimination Programme (Funding: Gates Foundation)",Description:"Document also contains meeting agenda and attendees 'Xenomonitoring for Lymphatic Filariasis' Washington DC",Year:"2011",Authors:"Subramanian, S., Sadanandanae, C., Vasuki, V., Srividya, A., AbdulKhader, M.S.M., Krishnamoorthy, K., Jambulingam, P.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"NO VALUE","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1816",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Monitoring of prevalence of infection in vectors in an era of elimination",Description:'Abstract for "Estimating Prevalence in mosquitoes,; sampling strategies and use of PoolScreen"',Year:"NO VALUE",Authors:"Unnasch, T.R., Katholi, C.R.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"1","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1819",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"Executive Summary Introduction Xenomonitoring: Sampling issues for Lymphatic filariasis",Description:"Extract from meeting report.

A much better fit is obtained with a truncated negative-binomial distribution, the k exponent of which is estimated to 0.3. This value does not seem to be affected by the endemic level, by microfilaricide mass-treatments or by the blood-sample volume. This result has immediate practical interests: it facilitates a posteriori comparisons between surveys in which different volumes of blood were examined; and at a given density, it allows calculating the change in sensitivity (detection rate) as a function of a change in the volume of blood examined, thus allowing better a priori planning of surveys. The paper provides the formulae required to calculate k, or, given k, to calculate the expected numbers in the various density classes. It also provides nomograms giving estimates of the true mean M and of the detection rate TD, given any one of the three following observations, made on observed positives: the median Dmf. 50, the mean m, or the percentage P1 having only 1 mf. The effect of changing the volume of blood on the rate of detection can then be read easily from the nomogram.

The mechanisms involved in this differential responsiveness appear to reflect different T-cell cytokine response patterns. Asymptomatic patients with the clinically silent presentation of asymptomatic microfilaraemia who have been previously described as being \u2018 immunosuppressed \u2019 with respect to their generating pro-inflammatory (Thl -type) immune responses to parasite antigen, are now recognized to be fully responsive to parasite antigen but to produce cytokines and mediators that have primarily anti-inflammatory (Th2-like) effects. Studies with immunodeficient mice have indicated the existence of two alternative pathways to the development of lymphatic pathology one dependent on the induction of inflammatory reactions by the host immune response, the other entirely independent of the immune system and reflecting the direct actions of the parasite or its products on the lymphatics. As histopathology of affected human lymphatics is consistent with this hypothesis, it may be that the lymphatic pathology seen normally in the amicrofilaraemic, highly immunoresponsive infected patients derives from inflammation induced by immune responses to parasite antigen, whereas the lymphatic pathology sometimes seen coexisting with the \u2018 immunosuppressed \u2019 state of asymptomatic microfilaraemia actually reflects lymphatic damage that is not immunologically mediated. Though little information exists about the natural history of lymphatic filariasis, there is no evidence for an inevitable progression from one clinical form to another. Instead, there appears to be a definite plasticity in the response that depends on prior (? pre-natal) and current exposure to the parasite as well as on the immunomodulatory effects it induces. This plasticity does not appear to be complete, however, as there is no evidence that a chronically infected host who has developed strong pro-inflammatory immune responses can subsequently become sufficiently down-regulated to support an asymptomatic microfilaraemia type of infection. Another possible constraint to the plasticity of the clinical and immunological responses may be the genetic determination of certain unusual syndromes, such as tropical pulmonary eosinophilia or TPE, though this hypothesis remains to be proven.",Year:"1992",Authors:"Ottesen, E.A.",Journal:"Parasitology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"104(S1)",Pages:"S71-S79","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1887",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Lymphatic filariasis: Diagnosis and pathogenesis",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1993",Authors:"Dennis, D.T., Dreyer, G., Ismail, M.M., Kumaraswami, V., Mak, J.W., Mataika, J.U., Ottesen, E.A., Piessens, W.F., Rajagopalan, P.K., Southgate, B.A., Huijin, Z.",Journal:"Bulletin of the World Health Organization",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"71(2)",Pages:"135-141","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1888",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Lymphatic abnormalities in human filariasis as depicted by lymphangioscintigraphy",Description:"Background: Investigation into filarial lymphedema has been hampered by the lack of a simple, safe, and easily repeated test to image the peripheral lymphatic system. Recent refinements in radionuclide lymphangioscintigraphy have established this noninvasive technique as the initial procedure of choice for visualizing lymphatics. Accordingly, we applied lymphangioscintigraphy to patients with filariasis and, for purposes of interpretation, compared the findings with those in patients with nonfilarial lymphedema. Methods: Thirty-three patients with classic symptoms or signs consistent with acute or chronic filariasis underwent lymphangioscintigraphy, and the findings were compared with those in five patients without lymphatic dysfunction and in 50 other patients with primary or secondary lymphedema without exposure to filariasis. Results: As in patients with nonfilarial lymphedema, seintigraphic abnormalities in the 33 patients with filariasis included delayed or absent tracer transport of the radiotracer (25 patients), tortuous and bizarre deep lymphatics (seven patients), dermal diffusion (15 patients), retrograde tracer flow (six patients), and faint or absent regional nodal visualization (14 patients). Even in patients with long-standing filarial lymphedema, peripheral trunks were often visualized (at least in part), and regional nodes and more central lymphatics sometimes filled after light exercise. In some of the latter patients, however, discrete lymphatic trunks were not detected.

Pathology appears to develop either in response to parasite products or when the host is unable to contain local inflammation - around dying microfilariae in the skin of onchocerciasis patients or in response to bacterial or fungal super-infection of tissues with compromised lymphatic function in patients with lymphatic filariasis. Therapeutic strategies to control morbidity associated with these infections are focused on decreasing both the parasite burden and the inflammatory burden caused by super-infecting microorganisms.

Selected examples are considered from viral and parasitic infections (arboviruses, malaria, the leishmaniases, filariases, Chagas Disease and schistosomiasis) where disease patterns have been directly or indirectly influenced by loss of natural tropical forests. A wide range of activities have resulted in deforestation. These include colonisation and settlement, transmigrant programmes, logging, agricultural activities to provide for cash crops, mining, hydropower development and fuelwood collection. Each activity influences the prevalence, incidence and distribution of vector-borne disease. Three main regions are considered - South America, West & Central Africa and South-East Asia. In each, documented changes in vector ecology and behaviour and disease pattern have occurred. Such changes result from human activity at the forest interface and within the forest. They include both deforestation and reafforestation programmes. Deforestation, or activities associated with it, have produced new habitats for Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and have caused malaria epidemics in South America. The different species complexes in South-East Asia (A. dirus, A. minimus, A. balabacensis) have been affected in different ways by forest clearance with different impacts on malaria incidence. The ability of zoophilic vectors to adapt to human blood as an alternative source of food and to become associated with human dwellings (peridomestic behaviour) have influenced the distribution of the leishmaniases in South America. Certain species of sandflies (Lutzomyia intermedia, Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmam), which were originally zoophilic and sylvatic, have adapted to feeding on humans in peridomestic and even periurban situations. The changes in behaviour of reservoir hosts and the ability of pathogens to adapt to new reservoir hosts in the newly-created habitats also influence the patterns of disease. In anthroponotic infections, such as Plasmodium, Onchocerca and Wuchereria, changes in disease patterns and vector ecology may be more difficult to detect. Detailed knowledge of vector species and species complexes is needed in relation to changing climate associated with deforestation. The distributions of the Anopheles gambiae and Simulium damnosum species complexes in West Africa are examples. There have been detailed longitudinal studies of Anopheles gambiae populations in different ecological zones of West Africa. Studies on Simulium damnosum cytoforms (using chromosome identification methods) in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme were necessary to detect changes in distribution of species in relation to changed habitats. These examples underline the need for studies on the taxonomy of medically-important insects in parallel with long-term observations on changing habitats. In some circumstances, destruction of the forest has reduced or even removed disease transmission (e.g. S. neavei-transmitted Onchocerca in Kenya). Whilst the process of deforestation can be expected to continue, hopefully at a decreased rate, it is expected that unpredictable and sometimes rapid changes in disease patterns will pose problems for the public health services.",Year:"1993",Authors:"Walsh, J.F., Molyneux, D.H., Birley, M.H.",Journal:"Parasitology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"106(S1)",Pages:"S55-S75","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1897",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"DRIVERS OF EMERGENT PARASITIC DISEASES",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2003",Authors:"Molyneux, D.",Journal:"Journal of Parasitology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"89(Suppl).",Pages:"S3-S13","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1898",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Vector-borne infections in the tropics and health policy issues in the twenty-first century",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2001",Authors:"Molyneux, D.H.",Journal:"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"95",Pages:"233-238","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1899",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Climate change and tropical disease Common themes in changing vector-borne disease scenarios",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2003",Authors:"Molyneux, D.H.",Journal:"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"97",Pages:"129-132","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1906",Category:"Action/Strategic Plans",Title:"Building Partnerships for Lymphatic Filariasis.",Description:"Overview: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring disease that has a major social and economic impact in Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific and parts of the Americas. Until recently, little could be done to relieve the suffering and disability caused by this disease. Today, however, significant advances have been made in understanding both the disease and its control. A global coalition has been forged among many organizations, each with a different mandate but all having a common goal: to tackle the wide-ranging and complex process of science and practice that will result in the elimination of LF as a public health problem1 from the world. A strong start was made in 1997 when the World Health Assembly passed a resolution calling for ' ... the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem ... '. Following this, WHO, with support from organizations including donor countries, the World Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began developing a coalition to eliminate the disease. The following year the coalition was given a powerful boost when SmithKiine Beech am announced its commitment to form a unique private-sector/public-sector collaboration with WHO to support the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. The two organizations pledged to work together closely to undertake this massive international public health effort. Subsequently, Merck & Co., Inc. pledged to expand its ongoing Mectizan\xAE Donation Program for onchocerciasis to cover treatment of lymphatic filariasis in all African countries where the two diseases occur together. Individually, none of these organizations can eliminate LF; but by working together, and working through the Ministries of Health in the endemic countries, we believe that it can be done.

The global strategy is a once-yearly, single-dose, two-drug regimen utilised by communities at risk for LF, with the goal of reaching 80% population coverage yearly, for at least 5 years, in order to interrupt transmission of LF. Where onchocerciasis is co-endemic, the regimen is ivermectin 200 - 400 \u03BCg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg; elsewhere, the regimen should be diethylcarbamazine 6 mg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg. This paper reviews in detail the evidence for the efficacy and safety of these two-drug regimens underpinning the global strategy and makes recommendations for future developments in chemotherapy for LF, focusing on unresolved issues.

The final step in this algorithm is a survey of the prevalence of filarial antigenemia among school entrants using lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS).

Therefore, in order to arrive at a simple procedure, four different methods (A, B, C and D) were tried for the extraction of DNA from mosquitoes infected with filarial parasite, Brugia malayi. Method D was found to be as efficient as the current procedure for the extraction of DNA from a single microfilaria in pools of 25 mosquitoes and the DNA was suitable for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, yielding a band of 322 base pairs with primers specific for B. malayi. Method D involved drying and crushing the mosquitoes to a powder, which was homogenized in 100 \u03BCl TE buffer, vortexed, boiled for 10 min, centrifuged at 14 000 r.p.m. for 10 min, and the supernatant used for the PCR assay. Dot-blot hybridization confirmed the specificity of the PCR amplified fragment. The DNA extracted by this method was stable for about 1 year. When comparing with the standard method, the cost of a single PCR reaction, inclusive of DNA extraction, was reduced by 50% and the hands on time was minimized fivefold.

Inflammatory responses are thought to be generated by either the parasite, the immune response, or opportunistic infection. We show that soluble extracts of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi can induce potent inflammatory responses, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, and nitric oxide (NO) from macrophages. The active component is heat stable, reacts positively in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, and can be inhibited by polymyxin B. TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, and NO responses were not induced in macrophages from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-nonresponsive C3H/HeJ mice. The production of TNF-\u03B1 after chemotherapy of microfilariae was also only detected in LPS-responsive C3H/HeN mice, suggesting that signaling through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is necessary for these responses. We also show that CD14 is required for optimal TNF-\u03B1 responses at low concentrations. Together, these results suggest that extracts of B. malayi contain bacterial LPS. Extracts from the rodent filaria, Acanthocheilonema viteae, which is not infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria found in the majority of filarial parasites, failed to induce any inflammatory responses from macrophages, suggesting that the source of bacterial LPS in extracts of B. malayi is the Wolbachia endosymbiont. Wolbachia extracts derived from a mosquito cell line induced similar LPS-dependent TNF-\u03B1 and NO responses from C3H/HeN macrophages, which were eliminated after tetracycline treatment of the bacteria. Thus, Wolbachia LPS may be one of the major mediators of inflammatory pathogenesis in filarial nematode disease.",Year:"2000",Authors:"Taylor, M.J., Cross, H.F., Bilo, K.",Journal:"Journal of Experimental Medicine",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"191(8)",Pages:"1429-1435","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"1996",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Side reactions following ivermectin therapy in high density bancroftian microfilaraemics",Description:"Side reactions following ivermectin treatment were evaluated in sixty males with high density bancroftian microfilaremia (GM 1388/ml).

Most filarial species that infect people co-exist in mutualistic symbiosis with Wolbachia bacteria, which are essential for growth, development, and survival of their nematode hosts. These endosymbionts contribute to inflammatory disease pathogenesis and are a target for doxycycline therapy, which delivers macrofilaricidal activity, improves pathological outcomes, and is effective as monotherapy.

A total of 3,683 children aged 5-12 years attending 27 primary schools in 13 Pacific Island countries were surveyed along with school environmental data. Stool samples were collected from 1996 children (54.2%) and analysed for ova and helminths. Total prevalence of helminthiasis was 32.8%. Anaemia prevalence was 12.4%. Children with helminthiasis and anaemia were found to be 8.7 times more likely to be stunted and 4.3 times more likely to be underweight than non-anaemic and non-infected children. Four significant environmental influences on helminthiasis were identified: (1) an inadequate water supply; (2); availability of a school canteen; (3) regular water/sanitation maintenance regimes; and (4) overcrowded classrooms.

Typically, they only appear in the human bloodstream at nighttime, synchronised with their mosquito vectors. In Polynesia and parts of Southeast Asia, free of nocturnal vectors, they are found at all hours, and each population biorhythm differs. Through a geometrical approach, we explain this circadian diversity by a single, dominant mutation: the clocks of individual parasites are set at midnight (ubiquitous) or at 2 p.m. Compared to other circadian genes, this mutation must be very old, as it is shared by four biologically remote genera of parasites.

Ten plants in every patch of Pandanus plantation were sampled at each village. Among 23,049 mosquito larvae collected from Upolu, 77% were the filariasis vector Aedes (Finlaya) samoanus, 17.7% were Ae.(Fin.)oceanicus and 5.3% were Ac.(Fin.)tutuilae. Out of 6981 larvae taken in Savai'i, 23.2% were Ae.samoanus, 67.6% Ae.oceanicus and 9.2% Ae.tutuilae. When larval counts per plant were analysed for each district, Ae.samoanus was found to predominate in Pandanus in Upolu and Ae.oceanicus in Savai'i. However, the adult density of Ae.samoanus was higher in Savai'i and this was attributed to the large areas of forests with Freycinetia for Ae.samoanus breeding. In Pandanus in Savai'i the number of Ae.samoanus was negligible. In Upolu, with more urbanization and larger plantations, there was greater breeding of Ae.samoanus in Pandanus. Two control trials were conducted against Ae.samoanus larvae in Pandanus, one using a sand culture of the parasitic nematode Romanomermis culicivorax and the other with temephos, an organophosphate insecticide.

In Savaii, Ae. samoanus predominated over Ae. polynesiensis except in "plantation" villages. Relatively high biting densities and rates of infection and infectivity indicated that Ae. samoanus was not less important than Ae. polynesiensis as a vector in Savaii. Ae. samoanus preferred natural vegetation, in contrast to Ae. polynesiensis which was found near human habitations in cultivated land. There was no difference between the biting densities of Ae. polynesiensis in "coastal" and "inland" villages, indicating that crab holes (numerous only in some coastal villages) may not influence the density of Ae. polynesiensis. Higher mf rates were associated with villages where Ae. polynesiensis, rather than Ae. samoanus, was dominant, indicating that Ae. polynesiensis was generally a more efficient vector. In the former villages, the difference in mf rates between males and females was smaller than in the latter, probably reflecting a difference in biting habits of the vectors. Ae. polynesiensis infections were recorded in plantations over 2 km from any village, suggesting that both habitats were foci of transmission.',Year:"1987",Authors:"Samarawickrema, W.A., Kimura, E., Spears, G.F.S., Penaia, L., Sone, F., Paulson, G.S., Cummings, R.F.",Journal:"Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"81(1)",Pages:"129-135","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0035-9203(87)90304-X",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"2178",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Observations on Culex quinquefasciatus Say in relation to transmission of filariasis due to subperiodic Wuchereria bancrofti in Samoa",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1992",Authors:"Samarawickrema, W.A., Sone, F., Paulson, G.S., Kimura, E., Uchida, K., Cummings, R.F.",Journal:"Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"86(5)",Pages:"517-522","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"2179",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Filarial infection in vector mosquitos after mass drug administration in Western Samoa",Description:"In order to control filariasis in Western Samoa, the first round of mass administration of diethylcarbamazine was carried out between 1965 and 1966, without undertaking any vector control measures. Four yr of post control entomologic evaluation has revealed that the infection rate has dropped from 8.35% to 0.61% (1/14 of pre control rate) in Aedes (Stegomyia) polynesiensis and 4.47% to 0.26% (1/17 of pre control rate) in Aedes (Finlaya) samoanus; and the infective rate has dropped from 2.95% to 0.070% (1.42 of pre control rate) in Ae. polynesiensis and 0.26% to 0 in Ae. samoanus. More reduction was observed in the infective rate than the infection rate, presumably because of a remarkable decrease in the number of filarial larvae in infected mosquitos. It is suggested that, for the entomologic evaluation of filariasis control, the infective rate should be preferred to the infection rate. Of the three infective Ae. polynesiensis detected after the campaign, one was found three mth after its completion and the other two at least 1 yr later.

The area of Guadalcanal plains has been known as the most malarious area of the Solomons. In spite of well executed DDT indoor spraying, malaria transmission was not interrupted. The causative factors responsible for this persisting transmission appeared to rest on three factors: refractoriness of Anopheles farauti to DDT spraying; the habit of people to stay outside late in the evening and a marked outdoor biting tendency of A. farauti. It was found that DDT indoor spraying alone had little impact on interruption of malaria transmission. This study conducted in early 1974 was planned to observe the change of mosquito population density in relation to the constriction of the river-mouth in north Guadalcanal in order to consider alternative means for malaria control. With the result of this study, one can assume, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the improvement of the malaria situation in north Guadalcanal would be associated with steady flow of the river water by maintaining the river/stream-mouth in an open condition.",Year:"1986",Authors:"Paik, Y-H.",Journal:"Japanese Journal of Experimental Medicine",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"57(1)",Pages:"47-52","Work Location":["Solomon Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"2207",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"The transplacental passage of malaria parasites in the Solomon Islands",Description:"A prospective study was undertaken to determine the extent of transplacental passage of malaria parasites in affected women attending for delivery at Kilu'ufi Hospital, Malaita Province, Solomon Islands. 11 women had parasitaemia and in 10 of these the placenta was infected.

This difference was compared with the pre-spray density so that the maximum permissible number of mosquitoes biting man without transmission of filariasis taking place, could be calculated. A theoretical value for m of 19-84 had been worked out previously; this study gave a corrected observed value of m of approximately 20, very close to the calculated theoretical value.

Overview: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis targets the global elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public-health problem by 2020. The main strategy is to interrupt transmission through integrated preventive chemotherapy, using mass drug administration to treat entire populations at risk of the disease, with a combination of albendazole plus ivermectin or albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine administered as a single dose once a year for at least 5 years. Because ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine can cause serious adverse effects in people infected with Loa loa causing loiasis (African eye worm), an endemic disease in a large part of central Africa, the current guidelines for preventive chemotherapy contain no recommendation for areas where lymphatic filariasis and loiasis are co-endemic but where onchocerciasis is hypo-endemic or non-endemic. Consequently, mass drug administration to eliminate lymphatic filariasis using the combination of medicines recommended by the World Health Organization could thus far not be implemented in these communities. In order to meet the 2020 goal, it has become urgent to develop an alternative strategy for interrupting transmission of lymphatic filariasis adapted to the specific situation of co-endemicity with Loa loa. This strategy could potentially include both medication and vector control. The milestones for the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis 2010\u20132020 stipulate that by 2012, a provisional strategy for interrupting lymphatic filariasis transmission in loiasis-endemic countries should have been developed; and that by 2013, a revised strategy for interrupting lymphatic filariasis transmission should have been implemented in all loiasis-endemic countries. In June 2011, a preliminary meeting on Loa loa in Lusaka, Zambia, proposed the following provisional strategies for eliminating lymphatic filariasis in areas where Loa loa is co-endemic: integrated vector management as the main strategy, and mapping of lymphatic filariasis and Loa loa at the lowest possible administrative level to potentially identify small areas that can be treated for lymphatic filariasis.",Year:"2012",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"World Health Organization","Volume/Issue":"WHO/HTM/NTD/PCT/2012.6",Pages:"25","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/75139",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"2769",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"Defining the Roles of Vector Control and Xenomonitoring in the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.

The term xenomonitoring was introduced for this approach. The GPELF was launched in 2000, based on two strategies: stopping transmission and alleviation of disability due to the disease.

Today's standards required development of a modern stability-indicating assay method for DEC and for DEC tablet dissolution. ADD Advanced Drug Delivery Technologies (Switzerland) developed a high-pressure liquid chromatography assay, which was independently validated and is in the United States Pharmacopoeia 25 (2002). After a global search, the project found that almost all existing and potential DEC active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and tablet manufacturers are in low-income countries. The project constructed an audit team to conduct on-site audits to assess good manufacturing practices according to European Union standards. National/state inspectors accompany the audit team. The team prequalified one DEC API manufacturer and three DEC tablet manufacturers. The project plans to increase the number of prequalified DEC manufacturers.

Yet there are robust, low-cost and effective public health interventions that can relieve that burden and enable people in poor settings to lead better lives. Preventive anthelminthic chemotherapy aims at using available anthelminthic drugs either alone or in combination as a public health tool for preventing morbidity due to more than one form of helminthiasis at once. The emphasis of preventive chemotherapy is therefore on the best, coordinated use of drugs rather than on specific forms of helminthiasis. The greatest challenge is to expand regular anthelminthic drug coverage as a public health intervention to reach all at risk of morbidity induced by helminth diseases. Working to achieve the objectives of a national programme for the control of Neglected Tropical Diseases by implementing preventive chemotherapy requires regular and careful monitoring of drug coverage.

Result of TAS with its recommendations prompted implementation of a LF MDA in the NWU region in February 2015 with the hope of a maximum coverage especially in areas where positive ICTs were found. The village of Faleasiu with the highest number of ICT positive, had a MDA coverage of 91%. However this high coverage was compromised by the low coverage rates from other constituencies, thus the overall coverage of 72%. Complementing MDA were vector control awareness programs in terms of source reduction and promoting the use of mosquito nets at home.

Final Report.",Description:`Executive Summary  There has been much effort by the Samoa government through its Ministry of Health to control Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) disease in the country. It has proven to be a very debilitating, disfiguring and stigmatized neglected tropical disease affecting Samoa. Since the early 1950s Samoa has collaborated with development partners such as WHO and later JICA, in this endeavour. Since 1999, a renewed regional effort with PacELF to push LF elimination, had seen several rounds of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) country-wide with at least eight MDAs implemented in Samoa itself.  
In accordance with surveillance methods recommended by WHO, the Ministry of Health carried out its first transmission assessment survey for LF in 2013. It discovered the North West Upolu (NWU) area, one of the three enumeration units (EU) in the country, continued transmission of LF microfilarial worms. Two further rounds of MDA were then implemented within this area alone, the first in February 2015 and the last one in April 2017.  
This year, Samoa implemented its second transmission assessment survey, to assess whether or not LF had been interrupted in the failed EU of NWU, which had received two MDAs and also whether there was recrudesence in Savaii and other parts of Upolu. Methodology for the survey was kept as similar as possible for comparisons. However, for antigenic testing, ICT cards were replaced with Filriasis Test Strips (FTS). The sampled population were those of grades one and two (six and seven year old) children from all primary schools around the country. As an added feature of the LF TAS survey this year it was agreed to implement alongside it, the Soil Transmitted Helminthic (STH) survey as an initial attempt to gather much needed data for the status of Helminthic infestation amongst the Samoan population. This used primary school children in grades three and four (ages 8 and 9 years) and it utilized the Kato Katz test to identify the different helminthes that may be present. 
Survey results for the 2017 LF TAS saw all Enumeration Units AUA + ROU; NWU and Savaii having rather significant recrudescence with LF prevalence rates of 1.43%; 6.79% and 5.25% respectively. Despite the difference in tests used and the slight drop in actual sampled number of the population used, LF prevalence rates were indeed profound and shows a definite rise in LF transmission continuing country-wide in Samoa. At this stage, there is much needed work to be done for the realization of LF elimination, in Samoa. 
Survey results for STH survey indicates infestation amongst school children, which however needs further detailed data which was missing in the current survey. Prevalence results cannot be calculated as a significant number of samples were not processed due to unforeseen difficulties with Laboratory staff availability. At best, this survey serves to indicate the need for better planning and perhaps a separation of these two surveys. It also highlighted Laboratory inadequacies for the processing of stool specimen, as an injunction for other significant Public Health infectious disease surveillance such as typhoid contact tracing. 
In effect, Public Health measures for control and elimination of LF as well as addressing other PH diseases of significance must be strengthened urgently and simultaneously.`,Year:"2017",Authors:"Samoa Ministry of Health",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"32","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3127",Category:"Action/Strategic Plans",Title:"NATIONAL ACTION PLAN TO ELIMINATE LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS IN SAMOA 2018 - 2024",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2017",Authors:"Samoa Ministry of Health",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"22","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3128",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Lymphatic Filariasis Transmission Assessment Survey 2013 Final Report 23 July 2013",Description:"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. Samoa has come a long way in trying to eliminate LF from the country in the form of country wide MDAs which first begun in 1962.  Since 1999, about eight rounds of MDAs with varying coverage rates had been completed in Samoa.  This year, Samoa would be assessing whether or not LF had been interrupted following the series of MDAs.  Using ICT cards, antigen prevalence would be assessed in the 3 regions of Samoa namely North West Upolu, Savaii and Rest of Upolu combined with Apia Urban Area.  To out rightly state that LF had been interrupted, children born after the MDAs would not be infected with LF if MDAs were effective.  Thus, in this Transmission Assessment Survey, children of all primary schools in grades 1 and 2 are targeted.  WHO argues that antigen prevalence of <0.5% would be too low to sustain transmission of LF in a country or region.  The result of the survey suggests that EU Savaii with a prevalence of 0.46% and EU Apia Urban Area and Rest of Upolu with a prevalence of 0.08% indicate interrupted LF transmission in these regions.  On the other hand, North West Upolu region which had been indicated in past prevalence surveys to be a problem area showed a prevalence rate of 1.49%.  As such, Samoa needs to consider conducting 2 more rounds of MDAs in the North West Upolu region and repeating the Transmission Assessment Survey after 2-3 years in Savaii and Apia Urban Area and Rest of Upolu to establish recrudescence. Simultaneously, Samoa needs to strengthen mosquito surveillance and control to address Lymphatic Filariasis as well as personal protection from mosquitoes.",Year:"2013",Authors:"Samoa National Disease Surveillance & International Health Regulations (IHR) Division",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"13","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3130",Category:"Meeting Reports",Title:"Binational planning between American Samoa and Samoa to accelerate elimination of lymphatic filariasis, 2017.

Prior antibody tests have suffered from poor sensitivity and/or specificity or from a lack of standardization. We conducted a multicenter evaluation of a new commercial ELISA that detects IgG4 antibodies to the recombinant filarial antigen Bm14. Four laboratories tested a shared panel of coded serum or plasma samples that included 55 samples from people with microfilaremic\xA0Wuchereria bancrofti\xA0or\xA0Brugia\xA0infections and 26 control samples. Qualitative results were identical in all four test sites. In addition, each laboratory tested samples from their own serum banks. The test detected antibodies in 32 of 36 samples (91%) from people with Brugian filariasis and in 96 of 98 samples (98%) from people with Bancroftian filariasis. Specificity testing showed that many serum or plasma samples from patients with other filarial infections such as onchocerciasis had positive antibody tests. Specificity was otherwise excellent, although 3 of 30 samples from patients with ascariasis and 4 of 51 with strongyloidiasis had positive antibody tests; it is likely that some or all of these people had previously lived in filariasis-endemic areas.

While long-lasting insecticide-treated nets remain effective against An. farauti, supplemental vector control strategies will be needed to achieve malaria elimination. Presently, the only World Health Organization recommended supplemental vector control strategy is larval source management (LSM). Effective targeted larval source management requires understanding the associations between abiotic, chemical and biological parameters of larval habitats with the presence or density of vector larvae. Methods: Potential and actual An. farauti larval habitats were characterized for presence and density of larvae and associated abiotic, chemical and biological parameters. Results: A third of all sampled potential habitats harboured An. farauti larvae with 80% of An. farauti positive habitats being in three habitat classifications (swamps/lagoons, transient pools and man-made holes). Large swamps were the most abundant positive habitats surveyed (43% of all An. farauti positive habitats). Habitats with An. farauti larvae were significantly associated with abiotic (pH, nitrate, ammonia and phosphate concentrations and elevated temperature) and biotic (predators) parameters. Conclusion: Large swamps and lagoons are the largest and most abundant An. farauti habitats in the Solomon Islands. Positive habitats were more frequently associated with the presence of predators (vertebrates and invertebrates) and higher water temperatures. Cohabitation with predators is indicative of a complex habitat ecosystem and raises questions about the potential of biological control as an effective control strategy. Increased presence of An. farauti with higher water temperature suggests a potential explanation for the coastal distribution of this species which is not found inland at elevated altitudes where temperatures would be cooler.",Year:"2019",Authors:"Mclaughlin, K., Burkot, T.R., Oscar, J., Beebe, N.W., Russell, T.L.",Journal:"Malaria Journal",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"18(1)",Pages:"416","Work Location":["Solomon Islands"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3155_McLaughlin_et_al_2019_Mar_J_Defining_the_larval_habitat_abiotic_and_biotic_paramters_associated_with_Anopheles_farauti_productivity.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3156",Category:"Books",Title:"A review of the Aedes scutellaris subgroup with a study of variation in Aedes pseudoscutellaris (Theobald) (Diptera: Culicidae)",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1954",Authors:"Marks, E.N.",Journal:"Bulletin of the British Museum (natural history) entomology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"3(10)",Pages:"350-414","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3157",Category:"Books",Title:"Aedes aegypti (L.)

Aedes polynesiensis is the main mosquito vector described in this territory. Other Aedes species have been reported, but recent entomological data are missing to infer the presence of other potential arbovirus vectors and to assess the entomological risk factors for transmission of arboviral diseases.
An entomological prospective study was conducted on the three main islands of the territory to determine the presence and distribution of Aedes spp. Larvae, pupae and adult mosquitoes were collected from 54 sampling points in different environments, with a final sampling of 3747 immature stages and 606 adults. The main identified breeding sites were described. Ae. polynesiensis was found in every sampled site in peridomestic and wild habitats. Ae. aegypti was only found on the island of Wallis in peridomestic environments with a limited distribution. Two other Aedes species endemic to the Pacific were recorded, Aedes oceanicus and Aedes futunae. To evaluate the ability of local Ae. polynesiensis to transmit the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), two field populations were analyzed for vector competence using experimental oral exposure of females to CHIKV and infection, dissemination and transmission assays. Results showed that both populations of Ae. polynesiensis were competent for CHIKV (30% at 7 days post-infection).
This study showed the ubiquitous distribution and abundance of Ae. polynesiensis on the three islands and demonstrated that local populations were able to transmit CHIKV. Combined with the presence and expansion of Ae. aegypti on the main island of Wallis, these data highlight the risk of transmission of arboviral diseases in the territory of Wallis and Futuna and provide relevant information for entomological surveillance and vector control programs.`,Year:"2020",Authors:"Calvez, E., Pocquet, N., Malau, A., Kilama, S., Taugamoa, A., Labrousse, D., Bouss\xE8s, P., Failloux, A.B., Dupont-Rouzeyrol, M., Mathieu-Daud\xE9, F.",Journal:"PLoS neglected tropical diseases",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"14(5)",Pages:"e0008250","Work Location":["Wallis and Futuna"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3160",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"New Guinea Culicidae, A synopsis of Vectors, pests and common species",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1964",Authors:"Van den Assem, J., Bonne-Wepster, J.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"Leiden Netherland: EJ Brill","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"1-136","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3161",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Polymerase chain reaction diagnosis and the changing pattern of vector ecology and malaria transmission in Papua New Guinea",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2004",Authors:"Benet, A., Mai, A., Bockarie, F., Lagog, M., Zimmerman, P., Alpers, M.P., Reeder, J.C., Bockarie, M.J.",Journal:"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"71(3)",Pages:"277-284","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.2004.71.277",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"3162",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Ribosomal DNA spacer genotypes of the Anopheles bancrofti group (Diptera: Culicidae) from Australia and Papua New Guinea",Description:"Mosquitoes of the Anopheles bancroftii group collected from Northern Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were investigated for sequence variation within the ribosomal DNA ITS2.

This phenomenon makes the interruption of filarial transmission by Aedes spp. particularly difficult. As the survival of anopheline mosquitoes is adversely affected by filarial infection, the use of mass drug administrations (MDA) to reduce the prevalence and intensity of microfilaraemias may increase the mean lifespan of some of the local Anopheles species. If these same species also act as vectors of malarial parasites, effective, drug-based control of W. bancrofti may worsen the problem posed by malaria.

Recently, 2 closely related species of the Aedes (Stegomyia) scutellaris group were received from the Fiji Islands. One was Aedes (Stegomyia) pseudoscutellaris (Theobald) and the other was Aedes (Stegomyia) polynesiensis Marks. Both species were collected as females biting man and as males resting, landing, and swarming in the Suva area, Viti Levu Island, Fiji Islands, which is the type locality of pseudoscutellaris. Unfortunately, they are extremely similar and very difficult to separate. The recent report by Rakai et ale (1970) on biting times of polynesiensis and pseudoscutellaris on Viti Levu, the main island in Fiji, indicated that both species were primarily day-time biters and the numbers of the 2 species caught were 827 for polynesiensis and 1,840 for pseudoscutellaris. However, no investigation on the transmission of filariasis was made to determine the relative importance of the 2 species as vectors of Wuchereria bancrofti on Viti Levu Island",Year:"1975",Authors:"Huang, Y.",Journal:"Mosquito Systematics",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"7(1)",Pages:"87-101","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3179",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Influence of environmental factors on the abundance of Anopheles farauti larvae in large brackish water streams in Northern Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands",Description:"Background.The main vector of malaria in Solomon Islands is Anopheles farauti, which has a mainly coastal distribution. In Northern Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, high densities of An. farauti are supported by large brackish streams, which in the dry season are dammed by localized sand migration. The factors controlling the high larval productivity of these breeding sites have not been identified. Accordingly the influence of environmental factors on the presence and density of An. farauti larvae was assessed in three large naturally dammed streams. Methods. Larval sites were mapped and anopheline larvae were collected monthly for 12 months (July 2007 to June 2008) from three streams using standard dippers. Larval collections were made from 10 locations spaced at 50 m intervals along the edge of each stream starting from the coast. At each collection point, floating filamentous algae, aquatic emergent plants, sun exposure, and salinity were measured. These environmental parameters along with rainfall were correlated with larval presence and density. Results. The presence and abundance of An. farauti larvae varied between streams and was influenced by the month of collection, and distance from the ocean (p < 0.001). Larvae were more frequently present and more abundant within 50 m of the ocean during the dry season when the streams were dammed. The presence and density of larvae were positively associated with aquatic emergent plants (presence: p = 0.049; density: p = 0.001). Although filamentous algae did not influence the presence of larvae, this factor did significantly influence the density of larvae (p < 0.001). Rainfall for the month prior to sampling was negatively associated with both larval presence and abundance (p < 0.001), as high rainfall flushed larvae from the streams. Salinity significantly influenced both the presence (p = 0.002) and density (p = 0.014) of larvae, with larvae being most present and abundant in brackish water at < 10\u2030 seawater. Conclusion. This study has demonstrated that the presence and abundance An. farauti larvae are influenced by environmental factors within the large streams. Understanding these parameters will allow for targeted cost effective implementation of source reduction and larviciding to support the frontline malaria control measures i.e. indoor residual spraying (IRS) and distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs).",Year:"2011",Authors:"Bugoro, H., Hii, J., Russell, T.L., Cooper, R.D., Chan, B.K., Iro'ofa, C., Butafa, C., Apairamo, A., Bobogare, A., Chen, C.C.",Journal:"Malaria Journal",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"10(1)",Pages:"1-11","Work Location":["Solomon Islands"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3179_Bugoro_2011_Mal_J_Influence_of_environmental_factors_on_the_abundance_of_Anopheles_farauti_larvae_in_large_brackish_water_streams_in_Northern_Guadalcanal_Solomon_Islands.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3180",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Mosquitoes collected on Weno Island, Romanum Island and Piis-Paneu Island, Chuuk State, the Federated States of Micronesia (Diptera: Culicidae)",Description:"Mosquito larval surveys were carried out on Weno Island, Romanum Island and Piis-Paneu Island, in Chuuk State, the Federated States of Micronesia in August 2011.

Eight thousand human and 1117 bird, bat and animal sera were tested for haemagglutination-inhibiting arbovirus antibody using a variety of group A, group B and Bunyamwera group antigens. Only a small number of low-titre reactions were found among the non-human sera, but 14% of all human sera were found to contain Group B antibody. The antibody prevalence increased with increasing age, from less than 1 % for persons born since 1950, to 70% for persons born before 1900. The age differences in prevalence could be used to estimate the time and size of previous epidemics. Differences were found in antibody prevalence between the sexes, between ethnic groups and between persons from different regions. These differences could be explained in terms of climate, location and custom. Historical and serological evidence both suggest that all the antibody detected was due to past exposure to dengue virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends height or age-based dosing as alternatives to weight-based dosing for mass drug administration lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination programs. The goals of our study were to compare these alternative dosing strategies to weight-based dosing and to develop and evaluate new height-based dosing pole scenarios. Methodology/Principal findings. Age, height and weight data were collected from >26,000 individuals in five countries during a cluster randomized LF clinical trial. Weight-based dosing for diethylcarbamazine (DEC; 6 mg/kg) and ivermectin (IVM; 200 ug/kg) with tablet numbers derived from a table of weight intervals was treated as the \u201Cgold standard\u201D for this study. Following WHO recommended age-based dosing of DEC and height-based dosing of IVM would have resulted in 32% and 27% of individuals receiving treatment doses below those recommended by weight-based dosing for DEC and IVM, respectively. Underdosing would have been especially common in adult males, who tend to have the highest LF prevalence in many endemic areas. We used a 3-step modeling approach to develop and evaluate new dosing pole cutoffs. First, we analyzed the clinical trial data using quantile regression to predict weight from height. We then used weight predictions to develop new dosing pole cutoff values. Finally, we compared different dosing pole cutoffs and age and height-based WHO dosing recommendations to weight-based dosing. We considered hundreds of scenarios including country- and sex-specific dosing poles. A simple dosing pole with a 6-tablet maximum for both DEC and IVM reduced the underdosing rate by 30% and 21%, respectively, and was nearly as effective as more complex pole combinations for reducing underdosing. Conclusions/Significance. Using a novel modeling approach, we developed a simple dosing pole that would markedly reduce underdosing for DEC and IVM in MDA programs compared to current WHO recommended height or age-based dosing.",Year:"2019",Authors:"Goss, C.W., O\u2019Brian, K., Dubray, C., Fischer, P.U., Hardy, M., Jambulingam, P., King, C.L., Laman, M., Lemoine, J.F., Robinson, L.J., Samuela, J., Subramanian, S., Supali, T., Weil, G.J., Schechtman, K.B.",Journal:"PLoS neglected tropical diseases",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"13(7)",Pages:"e0007541","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3202_Goss_et_al_2019_PLOS_NTDS_Dosing_pole.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3204",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Summary Note Lymphatic Filariasis Samoa",Description:"Reveiws MDA 1999 to 2003, 2006, 2008; MF and ICT results 1999 to 2005; Detail on MDA 2011; RPRG recommendations 2012, and plan for TAS in conjunction with STEPS survey",Year:"2012",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"Government of Samoa Ministry of Health","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"8","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3205",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"PacELF surveillance strategy development",Description:"7-23 June 2007 Objectives of mission: 1.

In American Samoa, where LF is caused by\xA0Wuchereria bancrofti, and\xA0Aedes polynesiensis\xA0is the main vector, the LF elimination program has made significant progress. Seven rounds of MDA (albendazole and diethycarbamazine) were completed from 2000 to 2006, and Transmission Assessment Surveys were passed in 2010/2011 and 2015. However, a seroprevalence study using an adult serum bank collected in 2010 detected two potential residual foci of transmission, with Og4C3 antigen (Ag) prevalence of 30.8% and 15.6%. We conducted a follow up study in 2014 to verify if transmission was truly occurring by comparing seroprevalence between residents of suspected hotspots and residents of other villages. In adults from non-hotspot villages (N = 602), seroprevalence of Ag (ICT or Og4C3), Bm14 antibody (Ab) and Wb123 Ab were 1.2% (95% CI 0.6\u20132.6%), 9.6% (95% CI 7.5%-12.3%), and 10.5% (95% CI 7.6\u201314.3%), respectively.

On both sides of Vanua Levu prevalences were lower inland than near the coast.Under apparently similar environmental conditions those of Fijian ethnic origin exhibited a higher prevalence of microfilaraemia than that shown by Indians. This ethnic difference and a difference between the prevalences in male and female Fijians are considered to be due more to higher rates of recovery from microfilaraemia in Indians and Fijian women than to diminished exposure to mosquitoes. Mathematical models have been used as an aid to the interpretation of the data, and, where appropriate, comparison has been made with the prevalence of antibodies to dengue, an arbovirus having the same vectors.Household infections were analysed by computer techniques. Infections in large households were not proportionately higher than in small households, indicating that transmission was not intrafamilial.

Under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) from 2000\u20132006. The World Health Organization recommends systematic post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of recent LF transmission. We compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-MDA surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6\u20137 years, and a community-based survey targeting people aged \u22658 years. Methods. In 2016, we conducted a systematic school-based TAS in all elementary schools (N = 29) and a cluster survey in 28 villages on the two main islands of American Samoa. We collected information on demographics and risk factors for infection using electronic questionnaires, and recorded geo-locations of schools and households. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using the Alere Filariasis Test Strip. For those who tested positive, we prepared slides for microscopic examination of microfilaria and provided treatment. Descriptive statistics were performed for questionnaire variables. Data were weighted and adjusted to account for sampling design and sex for both surveys, and for age in the community survey. Results. The school-based TAS (n = 1143) identified nine antigen-positive children and found an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3\u20131.8). Of the nine positive children, we identified one microfilariaemic 7-year-old child. The community-based survey (n = 2507, 711 households) identified 102 antigen-positive people, and estimated an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2% (95% CI: 4.5\u20138.6). Adjusted village-level prevalence ranged from 0\u201347.1%. CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. Of 86 antigen-positive community members from whom slides were prepared, 22 (25.6%) were microfilaraemic. School-based TAS had limited sensitivity (range 0\u201323.8%) and negative predictive value (range 25\u201383.3%) but had high specificity (range 83.3\u2013100%) and positive predictive value (range 0\u2013100%) for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. Conclusions. American Samoa failed the school-based TAS in 2016, and the community-based survey identified higher than expected numbers of antigen-positive people. School-based TAS was logistically simpler and enabled sampling of a larger proportion of the target population, but the results did not provide a good indication of the overall CFA prevalence in older age groups and was not sensitive at identifying foci of ongoing transmission. The community-based survey, although operationally more challenging, identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages, and foci of high antigen prevalence.

Current WHO guidelines support using the antigen card immunochromatographic test (ICT), which detects active filarial infection but does not detect early exposure to LF. Recent studies found that antibody-based assays better serve this function. In the present study, two tests, a rapid IgG4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a lateral-flow strip immunoassay, were developed based on the highly sensitive and specific Wuchereria bancrofti antigen Wb123. A comparison of W. bancrofti-infected and -uninfected patients (with or without other helminth infections) demonstrated that both tests had high sensitivities and specificities (93 and 97% [ELISA] and 92 and 96% [strips], respectively). When the W. bancrofti-uninfected group was separated into those with other filarial/helminth infections (i.e., onchocerciasis, loiasis, and strongyloidiasis) and those who were parasite uninfected, the specificities of the assays varied between 91 and 100%. In addition, the geometric mean response by ELISA of W. bancrofti-infected patients was significantly higher than the response of those without W. bancrofti infection (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the Wb123 ELISA and the lateral-flow strips had high positive and negative predictive values, giving valuable information on the size of survey population needed to be reasonably certain whether or not transmission is ongoing.

Two types of curves are fitted to previously published data. Fitting a linearized power curve through the data allows for correction for measurement error in human Mf counts. Ignoring measurement error leads to overestimation of the strength of density dependence; the degree of overestimation depends on the accuracy of measurement of Mf density. For use in mathematical models of transmission of lymphatic filariasis, a hyperbolic saturating function is preferable.

Seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) programmes between 2000 and 2006 reduced antigen prevalence to 2.3%. The most efficient methods of surveillance after MDA are not clear, but testing specific at-risk groups such as adults may provide earlier warning of resurgence. The role of migration from LF endemic countries in maintaining transmission also needs investigation. Few studies have investigated knowledge about LF and how that relates to infection risk. This study aims to investigate associations between socio-demographics, population mobility, disease knowledge and LF infection risk. Methods: In 2014, we surveyed 670 adults aged 16-68 years (62% female) at two worksites in American Samoa. Sera were tested for LF antigen and antibodies (Bm14 and Wb123) by rapid test and/or ELISA. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess association between seromarkers and demographic factors, household socioeconomic status (SES), residence, travel history, and knowledge of LF. Results: Overall, 1.8% of participants were positive for antigen, 11.8% for Bm14, 11.3% for Wb123 and 17.3% for at least one antibody. Recent travel outside American Samoa was not associated with positivity for any seromarker. Men had higher seroprevalence than women for all outcomes (any antibody: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.49 (95% CI: 2.21-5.49). Those aged over 35 years (compared to 15-24 years) had higher prevalence of Bm14 antibody (aOR = 3.75, 3.76 and 4.17 for ages 35-44, 45-54 and \u2265 55 years, respectively, P < 0.05). Lower SES was associated with seropositivity (antigen: aOR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.09-7.69; either antibody: aOR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.12-2.05). Those who knew that mosquitoes transmitted LF had lower Wb123 antibody prevalence (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.32-0.95). Conclusions: Opportunistic sampling of adults at worksites provided an efficient and representative way to assess prevalence and risk factors for LF in American Samoa and in hindsight, foreshadowed the resurgence of transmission. Risk of LF infection, detected by one or more serological markers, was not related to recent travel history, but was strongly associated with male gender, older age, lower SES, and lack of knowledge about mosquito transmission. These results could guide future efforts to increase MDA participation.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] \xA9 2020 The Author(s).",Year:"2020",Authors:"Graves, P.M., Sheridan, S., Fuimaono, S., Lau, C.L.",Journal:"Parasites and Vectors",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"13(1)",Pages:"125","Work Location":["American Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3220_Graves_et_al_2014_Parasites-and-Vectors_Demographic-socioeconomic-and-disease-knowledge-factors-but-not-population-mobility.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3222",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"The safety of combined triple drug therapy with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole in the neglected tropical diseases co-endemic setting of fiji: A cluster randomised trial",Description:"Lymphatic filariasis has remained endemic in Fiji despite repeated mass drug administration using the well-established and safe combination of diethylcarbamazine and albendazole (DA) since 2002. In certain settings the addition of ivermectin to this combination (IDA) remains a safe strategy and is more efficacious. However, the safety has yet to be described in scabies and soil-transmitted helminth endemic settings like Fiji. Villages of Rotuma and Gau islands were randomised to either DA or IDA. Residents received weight-based treatment unblinded with standard exclusions. Participants were actively found and asked by a nurse about their health daily for the first two days and then asked to seek review for the next five days if unwell. Anyone with severe symptoms were reviewed by a doctor and any serious adverse event was reported to the Medical Monitor and Data Safety Monitoring Board. Of 3612 enrolled and eligible participants, 1216 were randomised to DA and 2396 to IDA. Age and sex in both groups were representative of the population. Over 99% (3598) of participants completed 7 days follow-up. Adverse events were reported by 600 participants (16.7%), distributed equally between treatment groups, with most graded as mild (93.2%). There were three serious adverse events, all judged not attributable to treatment by an independent medical monitor. Fatigue was the most common symptom reported by 8.5%, with headache, dizziness, nausea and arthralgia being the next four most common symptoms. Adverse events were more likely in participants with microfilaremia (43.2% versus 15.7%), but adverse event frequency was not related to the presence of scabies or soil-transmitted helminth infection. IDA has comparable safety to DA with the same frequency of adverse events experienced following community mass drug administration. The presence of co-endemic infections did not increase adverse events. IDA can be used in community pro-grams where preventative chemotherapy is needed for control of lymphatic filariasis and other neglected tropical diseases. \xA9 2020 Hardy et al.",Year:"2020",Authors:"Hardy, M., Samuela, J., Kama, M., Tuicakau, M., Romani, L., Whitfeld, M.J., King, C.L., Weil, G.J., Grobler, A.C., Robinson, L.J., Kaldor, J.M., Steer, A.C.",Journal:"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"14(3)",Pages:"e0008106","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3222_Hardy_et_al_2020_PLOS_NTDs_The-safety-of-combined-triple-drug-therapy-with-ivermectin-diethylcarbamazine-and-albendazole-in-the-NTD-coendemic-setting-of-fiji.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3223",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"An expanded transmission assessment survey to confirm the interruption of lymphatic filariasis transmission in Wallis and Futuna",Description:"Historically, the human prevalence of Wuchereria bancrofti infection in Wallis and Futuna (WAF) was among the highest in the Pacific and mass drug administration (MDA) against lymphaticfilariasis (LF) either with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) or the combination of DEC and albendazole had been implemented for decades. To determine whether LF antigen prevalence in WAF was lower than 1%, the infection threshold for elimination in an area where Aedes spp. are the principal vectors, we conducted the WHO-recommended transmission assessment survey in 2012. We present the resultsofa school-based survey, which targeted 1,014 students in all 13 elementary schools in WAF. From afingerprick, the circulating filarial antigen (CFA) positivity was checked for grade 2-5 students using BinaxNOW filariasis test (immunochromatographic test). Of 935 children tested, three were positive for CFAintwo schools. At the territory level, this was below the critical cutoff of nine cases, if the whole territory was considered as a single evaluation unit. The prevalence of CFA in WAF is less than 1%, reaching the goal for LF elimination set by the WHO. We were able to recommend stopping LF MDA and move to post-MDA surveillance to detect any recrudescence. This survey successfully paved the way for WAF to be validated as achieving LF elimination as a public health problem by 2020.

Little has been documented about the burden of disability due to the chronic complications of the disease. We examined the rates of hydrocoele amongst the Samoan male population to better understand the situation. Methods: Information on numbers of suspected hydrocoele cases in men aged 18 years and older from 2006 to 2013 was sought using ICD-10 codes and/or keywords from three sources: the hospital patient information system plus the surgical clinic and operating theater records in Tupua Tamasese Meaole and Malietoa Tanumafili II hospitals in Samoa. Chart review of suspected hydrocoele cases was used to confirm the diagnosis of hydrocoele amongst suspected cases. The following data items were extracted from patient records where available: date of diagnosis, age, village, hydrocoele characteristics (duration, size, and volume), history and cause of injuries, whether lymphatic filariasis was a differential diagnosis, whether ultrasound scan was used to verify diagnosis, and details of any surgery performed. Population data were obtained from the Samoa Bureau of Statistics. Results: There were 535 suspected cases identified from the 3 sources between 2006 and 2013, of which 328 were diagnosed as hydrocoele; charts for 56 suspected cases (10.5%) could not be located. The mean age of men with hydrocoele was 49.2 years. The proportion of men aged \u2265 18 years diagnosed with hydrocoele over the study period was 0.62% (328/52,944). North West Upolu had the highest proportion amongst the four regions of Samoa (p < 0.001). The proportion of men presenting with hydrocoele increased with age (p < 0.001). 14.3% of patients had an injury that could have contributed to the hydrocoele. Only 4.0% of all patient records had lymphatic filariasis recorded as a differential diagnosis. 60.7% of all patients with hydrocoele had some form of surgery, with no difference between regions (p = 0.276). The majority of surgeries were hydrocoelectomies, where the tunica vaginalis is everted. The mean age of patients that had surgery was 48.2 years. It was difficult to estimate hydrocoele size and duration due to non-standardized way of reporting. Conclusions: This study used multiple sources to document the number of hydrocoele cases that presented annually to medical facilities in Samoa. This represents a minimum estimate of the burden since some cases may have not presented for treatment. The numbers presenting have fluctuated over the years (2006 to 2013), and improvements in the reporting system are needed. The health system needs to consider ways to address a large number of patients that still require surgery, as well as conducting follow-up of those that did receive surgery. Additionally, clinicians should consider lymphatic filariasis as a differential diagnosis for hydrocoeles. \xA9 2019 The Author(s).",Year:"2019",Authors:"Ah Leong-Lui, T.A., Graves, P.M., Naseri, T.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"47(1)",Pages:"51","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3224_Ah_Leong-Lui_et_al_2020_Burden-of-hydrocoele-assessed-from-medical-and-surgical-records-in-a-lymphatic-filariasis-endemic-country-SamoaTropical-Medicine-and-Health.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3225",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem from Tonga",Description:"Background: Tonga was highly endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by diurnally sub-periodic Wuchereria bancrofti transmitted by Aedes vector species. LF prevalence declined very appreciably as a result of chemotherapeutic intervention measures implemented in 1977, but low levels of infection persisted. Along with other Pacific Island countries and in partnership with the Pacific Programme to Eliminate LF (PacELF), Tonga implemented a programme to eliminate LF as a public health problem. Methods: On the basis of historical data and baseline survey, all the divisions of the country were declared as endemic. Five to six consecutive rounds of effective MDA were implemented in all the divisions during 2001-2006. The impact of MDA was assessed through interim and post-MDA antigen (Ag) detection surveys among adults and transmission assessment surveys among children. The chronic disease burden was assessed by health workers through observation. Results: The base-line Ag prevalence was 2.70%. The treatment coverage was > 80% in all MDA rounds. The mid-term surveys showed an Ag prevalence of 2.46%. The pre-stop MDA Ag survey revealed an Ag prevalence of 0.34%. The stop MDA survey and transmission assessment surveys among children showed Ag prevalence at < 0.05%, indicating transmission is negligible. Health workers concluded that filarial lymphedema or hydrocele condition in the communities is absent or very rare. Conclusion: Tonga had successfully met the criteria for elimination of LF as a public health problem. The accomplishment was acknowledged by the WHO in 2017. Tonga looks forward to work with stakeholders to eliminate transmission of LF and achieve zero incidence of infection. \xA9 2019 The Author(s).",Year:"2019",Authors:"Ofanoa, R., Ofa, T., Padmasiri, E.A., Kapa, D.R.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"47(1)",Pages:"43","Work Location":["Tonga"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3225_Ofanoa_et_al_2019_TROP_MED_HLTH_Elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis-as-a-public-health-problem-from-TongaTropical-Medicine-and-Health.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3226",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in Niue under PacELF, 1999-2016",Description:"Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease which is targeted for elimination as a public health problem worldwide. Niue is a small self-governing South Pacific island nation with approximately 1600 residents that was formerly LF endemic. Here, we review the progress made towards eliminating LF in Niue since 1999. Methods: This study has reviewed all the available literature relating to LF in Niue to assess surveillance efforts and the elimination of transmission. Reviewed documentation included both published and unpublished works including historical reports of LF, WHO PacELF records, and Niue Country Reports of the national LF elimination program. Findings: Niue conducted mapping of baseline LF endemicity by testing the total present and consenting population for LF antigen with immunochromatographic test (ICT) in 1999, when circulating filarial antigen prevalence was 3.1% (n = 1794). Five nationwide annual mass drug administration (MDA) rounds with albendazole (400 mg) and diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) were undertaken from 2000 to 2004, with coverage reported from distribution records ranging from 78 to 99% of the eligible population, which excluded pregnant women and children under 2 years of age. A further whole population survey using ICT in 2001 found 1.3% positive (n = 1630). In 2004, antigen prevalence had reduced to 0.2% (n = 1285). A similar post-MDA survey in 2009 indicated antigen prevalence to be 0.5% (n = 1378). Seven positive cases were re-tested and re-treated every six months until negative. Conclusions: After five rounds of MDA, Niue had reduced the LF antigen population prevalence in all ages from 3.1% to below 1% and maintained this prevalence for a further five years. Due to Niue's small population, surveillance was done by whole population surveys. Niue's results support the WHO recommended strategy that five to six rounds of annual MDA with effective population coverage can successfully interrupt the transmission of LF. Niue received official acknowledgement of the validation of elimination of LF as a public health problem by the WHO Director-General and WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) Regional Director at the 67th session of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific held in Manila in October 2016. \xA9 2019 World Health Organization.",Year:"2019",Authors:"Carlingford, C.N., Melrose, W., Mokoia, G., Graves, P.M., Ichimori, K., Capuano, C., Kim, S.H., Aratchige, P., Nosa, M.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"47(1)",Pages:"20","Work Location":["Niue"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3226_Carlingford_et_al_2019_TROP_MED_HLTH_Elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis-as-a-public-health-problem-in-Niue-under-PacELF-19992016Tropical-Medicine-and-Health.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3227",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"GEOFIL: A spatially-explicit agent-based modelling framework for predicting the long-term transmission dynamics of lymphatic filariasis in American Samoa",Description:"In this study, a spatially-explicit agent-based modelling framework GEOFIL was developed to predict lymphatic filariasis (LF) transmission dynamics in American Samoa. GEOFIL included individual-level information on age, gender, disease status, household location, household members, workplace/school location and colleagues/schoolmates at each time step during the simulation. In American Samoa, annual mass drug administration from 2000 to 2006 successfully reduced LF prevalence dramatically. However, GEOFIL predicted continual increase in microfilaraemia prevalence in the absence of further intervention. Evidence from seroprevalence and transmission assessment surveys conducted from 2010 to 2016 indicated a resurgence of LF in American Samoa, corroborating GEOFIL's predictions. The microfilaraemia and antigenaemia prevalence in 6-7-yo children were much lower than in the overall population. Mosquito biting rates were found to be a critical determinant of infection risk. Transmission hotspots are likely to disappear with lower biting rates. GEOFIL highlights current knowledge gaps, such as data on mosquito abundance, biting rates and within-host parasite dynamics, which are important for improving the accuracy of model predictions. \xA9 2019 The Authors",Year:"2019",Authors:"Xu, Z., Graves, P.M., Lau, C.L., Clements, A., Geard, N., Glass, K.",Journal:"Epidemics",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"27",Pages:"19-27","Work Location":["American Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3226_Xu_et_al_2019_EPIDEMICS_GEOFIL-A-spatiallyexplicit-agentbased-modelling-framework-for-predicting-the-longterm-transmission-dynamics-of-lymphatic-filariasis-in-American-Samoa.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3228",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Human Migration and the Spread of the Nematode Parasite Wuchereria bancrofti",Description:"The human disease lymphatic filariasis causes the debilitating effects of elephantiasis and hydrocele. Lymphatic filariasis currently affects the lives of 90 million people in 52 countries. There are three nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti, but 90% of all cases of lymphatic filariasis are caused solely by W. bancrofti (Wb). Here we use population genomics to reconstruct the probable route and timing of migration of Wb strains that currently infect Africa, Haiti, and Papua New Guinea (PNG). We used selective whole genome amplification to sequence 42 whole genomes of single Wb worms from populations in Haiti, Mali, Kenya, and PNG. Our results are consistent with a hypothesis of an Island Southeast Asia or East Asian origin of Wb. Our demographic models support divergence times that correlate with the migration of human populations. We hypothesize that PNG was infected at two separate times, first by the Melanesians and later by the migrating Austronesians. The migrating Austronesians also likely introduced Wb to Madagascar where later migrations spread it to continental Africa. From Africa, Wb spread to the New World during the transatlantic slave trade. Genome scans identified 17 genes that were highly differentiated among Wb populations. Among these are genes associated with human immune suppression, insecticide sensitivity, and proposed drug targets. Identifying the distribution of genetic diversity in Wb populations and selection forces acting on the genome will build a foundation to test future hypotheses and help predict response to current eradication efforts. \xA9 2019 The Author(s).

To this end, serological assays have been developed, including the Bm14 Filariasis CELISA which recommends a specific optical density cut-off level. We used mixture modelling to assess positive cut-offs of Bm14 serology in children in Vanuatu using historical OD (Optical Density) ELISA values collected from a transmission assessment survey (2005) and a targeted child survey (2008). Mixture modelling is a statistical technique using probability distributions to identify subpopulations of positive and negative results (absolute cut-off value) and an 80% indeterminate range around the absolute cut-off (80% cut-off). Depending on programmatic choices, utilizing the lower 80% cut-off ensures the inclusion of all likely positives, however with the trade-off of lower specificity. For 2005, country-wide antibody prevalence estimates varied from 6.4% (previous cut-off) through 9.0% (absolute cut-off) to 17.3% (lower 80% cut-off). This corroborated historical evidence of hotspots in Pentecost Island in Penama province. For 2008, there were no differences in the prevalence rates using any of the thresholds. In conclusion, mixture modelling is a powerful tool that allows closer monitoring of residual transmission spots and these findings supported additional monitoring which was conducted in Penama in later years. Utilizing a statistical data-based cut-off, as opposed to a universal cut-off, may help guide program decisions that are better suited to the national program. \xA9 2019 by the authors.

Recent trials have shown that a single-dose, triple-drug treatment (ivermectin with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole [IDA]) is superior to a two-drug combination (diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole [DA]) that is widely used in LF elimination programs. This study was performed to assess the safety of IDA and DA in a variety of endemic settings. Methods and findings Large community studies were conducted in five countries between October 2016 and November 2017. Two studies were performed in areas with no prior mass drug administration (MDA) for filariasis (Papua New Guinea and Indonesia), and three studies were performed in areas with persistent LF despite extensive prior MDA (India, Haiti, and Fiji). Participants were treated with a single oral dose of IDA (ivermectin, 200 \u03BCg/kg; diethylcarbamazine, 6 mg/kg; plus albendazole, a fixed dose of 400 mg) or with DA alone. Treatment assignment in each study site was randomized by locality of residence. Treatment was offered to residents who were \u22655 years of age and not pregnant. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by medical teams with active follow-up for 2 days and passive follow-up for an additional 5 days. A total of 26,836 persons were enrolled (13,535 females and 13,300 males). A total of 12,280 participants were treated with DA, and 14,556 were treated with IDA. On day 1 or 2 after treatment, 97.4% of participants were assessed for AEs. The frequency of all AEs was similar after IDA and DA treatment (12% versus 12.1%, adjusted odds ratio for IDA versus DA 1.15, 95% CI 0.87\u20131.52, P = 0.316); 10.9% of participants experienced mild (grade 1) AEs, 1% experienced moderate (grade 2) AEs, and 0.1% experienced severe (grade 3) AEs. Rates of serious AEs after DA and IDA treatment were 0.04% (95% CI 0.01%\u20130.1%) and 0.01% (95% CI 0.00%\u20130.04%), respectively. Severity of AEs was not significantly different after IDA or DA. Five of six serious AEs reported occurred after DA treatment. The most common AEs reported were headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and fatigue. AE frequencies varied by country and were higher in adults and in females. AEs were more common in study participants with microfilaremia (33.4% versus 11.1%, P < 0.001) and more common in microfilaremic participants after IDA than after DA (39.4% versus 25.6%, P < 0.001). However, there was no excess of severe or serious AEs after IDA in this subgroup. The main limitation of the study was that it was open-label. Also, aggregation of AE data from multiple study sites tends to obscure variability among study sites. Conclusions In this study, we observed that IDA was well tolerated in LF-endemic populations. Posttreat-ment AE rates and severity did not differ significantly after IDA or DA treatment. Thus, results of this study suggest that IDA should be as safe as DA for use as a MDA regimen for LF elimination in areas that currently receive DA. \xA9 2019, Public Library of Science.

This trial tested whether a single dose of a three-drug regimen of ivermectin plus diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole results in a greater sustained clearance of microfilariae than a single dose of a two-drug regimen of diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole and is noninferior to the two-drug regimen administered once a year for 3 years. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled trial involving adults from Papua New Guinea with Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaremia, we assigned 182 participants to receive a single dose of the three-drug regimen (60 participants), a single dose of the two-drug regimen (61 participants), or the two-drug regimen once a year for 3 years (61 participants). Clearance of microfilariae from the blood was measured at 12, 24, and 36 months after trial initiation. RESULTS: The three-drug regimen cleared microfilaremia in 55 of 57 participants (96%) at 12 months, in 52 of 54 participants (96%) at 24 months, and in 55 of 57 participants (96%) at 36 months. A single dose of the two-drug regimen cleared microfilaremia in 18 of 56 participants (32%) at 12 months, in 31 of 55 participants (56%) at 24 months, and in 43 of 52 participants (83%) at 36 months (P=0.02 for the three-drug regimen vs. a single dose of the two-drug regimen at 36 months). The two-drug regimen administered once a year for 3 years cleared microfilaremia in 20 of 59 participants (34%) at 12 months, in 42 of 56 participants (75%) at 24 months, and in 51 of 52 participants (98%) at 36 months (P=0.004 for noninferiority of the three-drug regimen vs. the two-drug regimen administered once a year for 3 years at 36 months). Moderate adverse events were more common in the group that received the three-drug regimen than in the combined two-drug-regimen groups (27% vs. 5%, P<0.001). There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The three-drug regimen induced clearance of microfilariae from the blood for 3 years in almost all participants who received the treatment and was superior to the two-drug regimen administered once and noninferior to the two-drug regimen administered once a year for 3 years.

Insights from mathematical models",Description:"Background. With the 2020 target year for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) approaching, there is an urgent need to assess how long mass drug administration (MDA) programs with annual ivermectin + albendazole (IA) or diethylcarbamazine + albendazole (DA) would still have to be continued, and how elimination can be accelerated. We addressed this using mathematical modeling. Methods. We used 3 structurally different mathematical models for LF transmission (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, TRANSFIL) to simulate trends in microfilariae (mf) prevalence for a range of endemic settings, both for the current annual MDA strategy and alternative strategies, assessing the required duration to bring mf prevalence below the critical threshold of 1%. Results. Three annual MDA rounds with IA or DA and good coverage (\u226565%) are sufficient to reach the threshold in settings that are currently at mf prevalence <4%, but the required duration increases with increasing mf prevalence. Switching to biannual MDA or employing triple-drug therapy (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole [IDA]) could reduce program duration by about one-third. Optimization of coverage reduces the time to elimination and is particularly important for settings with a history of poorly implemented MDA (low coverage, high systematic noncompliance). Conclusions. Modeling suggests that, in several settings, current annual MDA strategies will be insufficient to achieve the 2020 LF elimination targets, and programs could consider policy adjustment to accelerate, guided by recent monitoring and evaluation data. Biannual treatment and IDA hold promise in reducing program duration, provided that coverage is good, but their efficacy remains to be confirmed by more extensive field studies. \xA9 The Author(s) 2018.

Papua New Guinea (PNG) is one of the highest priority countries in the Western Pacific for lymphatic filariasis and the site of extensive research on lymphatic filariasis and surveys of its prevalence. However, different diagnostic tests have been used and thresholds for each test are unclear. Methods: We reviewed the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis reported in 295 surveys conducted in PNG between 1990 and 2014, of which 65 used more than one test. Results from different diagnostics were standardised using a set of criteria that included a model to predict antigen prevalence from microfilariae prevalence. We mapped the point location of each of these surveys and categorised their standardised prevalence estimates. Results: Several predictive models were produced and investigated, including the effect of any mass drug administration and number of rounds prior to the surveys. One model was chosen based on goodness of fit parameters and used to predict antigen prevalence for surveys that tested only for microfilariae. Standardised prevalence values show that 72% of all surveys reported a prevalence above 0.05. High prevalence was situated on the coastal north, south and island regions, while the central highland area of Papua New Guinea shows low levels of prevalence. Conclusions: Our study is the first to provide an explicit predictive relationship between the prevalence values based on empirical results from antigen and microfilaria tests, taking into account the occurrence of mass drug administration. This is a crucial step to combine studies to develop risk maps of lymphatic filariasis for programme planning and evaluation, as shown in the case of Papua New Guinea. \xA9 2018 The Author(s).",Year:"2018",Authors:"Berg Soto, A., Xu, Z., Wood, P., Sanuku, N., Robinson, L.J., King, C.L., Tisch, D., Susapu, M., Graves, P.M.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"46(1)",Pages:"41","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3235_Berg_Soto_et_al_2018_TROP_MED_HEALTH_Combining-different-diagnostic-studies-of-lymphatic-filariasis-for-risk-mapping-in-Papua-New-Guinea-.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3236",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Comparison of antigen and antibody responses in repeat lymphatic filariasis transmission assessment surveys in American Samoa",Description:"Background: Current WHO recommendations for lymphatic filariasis (LF) surveillance advise programs to implement activities to monitor for new foci of transmission after stopping mass drug administration (MDA). A current need in the global effort to eliminate LF is to standardize diagnostic tools and surveillance activities beyond the recommended transmission assessment survey (TAS). Methodology: TAS was first conducted in American Samoa in 2011 (TAS 1) and a repeat TAS was carried out in 2015 (TAS 2). Circulating filarial antigen (CFA) and serologic results from both surveys were analyzed to determine whether interruption of LF transmission has been achieved in American Samoa. Principal findings: A total of 1,134 and 864 children (5\u201310 years old) were enrolled in TAS 1 and TAS 2, respectively. Two CFA-positive children were identified in TAS 1, and one CFA-positive child was identified in TAS 2. Results of both surveys were below the threshold for which MDA was warranted. Additionally, 1,112 and 836 dried blood spots from TAS 1 and TAS 2, respectively were tested for antibodies to Wb123, Bm14 and Bm33 by luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay and multiplex bead assay. In 2011, overall prevalence of responses to Wb123, Bm14, and Bm33 was 1.0%, 6.8% and 12.0%, respectively. In 2015, overall prevalence of positive Bm14 and Bm33 responses declined significantly to 3.0% (p<0.001) and 7.8% (p = 0.013), respectively. Conclusions/Significance: Although passing TAS 1 and TAS 2 and an overall decline in the prevalence of antibodies to Bm14 and Bm33 between these surveys suggests decreased exposure and infection among young children, there were persistent responses in some schools. Clustering and persistence of positive antibody responses in schools may be an indication of ongoing transmission. There is a need to better understand the limitations of current antibody tests, but our results suggest that serologic tools can have a role in guiding programmatic decision making. \xA9 2018 Public Library of Science.

Though the infection prevalence had declined between 1975 and 1999 following episodic treatment activities, still infection was widespread with pockets of persistent infection. Beginning in 1999, the Cook Islands embarked on a national program, in partnership with Pacific Programme to Eliminate LF (PacELF), to eliminate LF as a public health problem. Methods: All 12 inhabited islands were identified as endemic, and six rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with once-yearly, single-dose albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine (DEC) were implemented during 2000-2006 to interrupt transmission of LF. Surveys carried out at the baseline, mid-term, stop-MDA, and post-MDA periods assessed LF antigen (Ag) prevalence in children and adults. Historical data, health workers' observations, and hospital records were used to assess the trend and burden of chronic disease. Results: The baseline Ag prevalence (1999) ranged from 2.0% in Manihiki to > 18.0% in Aitutaki, Mitiaro, and Pukapuka, and the national average Ag prevalence was 8.6%. MDA, carried out with a national treatment coverage over six annual rounds of MDA ranging from 63.5 to 96.7% in different years, was stopped in 2007. By then, the national Ag prevalence had declined to 0.27%. The post-MDA surveillance survey results (2013-2014) showed that Ag prevalence had fallen to 0% in 11/12 islands, and the national prevalence was only 0.03%. Chronic filarial disease had almost entirely disappeared. Conclusion: The Cook Islands met all the criteria required for the World Health Organization (WHO) to acknowledge elimination of LF as a public health problem, as it did officially in 2016. This success also confirms that LF, even when transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that are recognized to be more efficient than other vector species, can be eliminated as a public health problem by six rounds of MDA. \xA9 2018 The Author(s).",Year:"2018",Authors:"Ave, C., Kapa, D.R., Ottesen, E.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"46(1)",Pages:"12","Work Location":["Cook Islands"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3237_Ave_et_al_2018_TROP_MED_HEALTH_Elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis-as-a-public-health-problem-from-the-Cook-IslandsTropical-Medicine-and-Health.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3238",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Filariasis elimination, vector control and eradication challenges: Commentary on Webber, R.

In French Polynesia, Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, and Aedes polynesiensis the primary vector of Bancroftian filariasis and a secondary vector of arboviruses. Tools for assessing the risk of disease transmission or for measuring the efficacy of vector control programmes are scarce. A promising approach to quantify the human-vector contact relies on the detection and the quantification of antibodies directed against mosquito salivary proteins. Methodology/Principal findings: An ELISA test was developed to detect and quantify the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against proteins from salivary gland extracts (SGE) of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis in human populations exposed to either species, through a cross-sectional study. In Tahiti and Moorea islands where Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis are present, the test revealed that 98% and 68% of individuals have developed IgG directed against Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE, respectively. By comparison, ELISA tests conducted on a cohort of people from metropolitan France, not exposed to these Aedes mosquitoes, indicated that 97% of individuals had no IgG directed against SGE of either mosquito species. The analysis of additional cohorts representing different entomological Aedes contexts showed no ELISA IgG cross-reactivity between Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE. Conclusions/Significance: The IgG response to salivary gland extracts seems to be a valid and specific biomarker of human exposure to the bites of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis. This new immuno-epidemiological tool will enhance our understanding of people exposure to mosquito bites, facilitate the identification of areas where disease transmission risk is high and permit to evaluate the efficacy of novel vector control strategies in Pacific islands and other tropical settings. \xA9 2018 Mathieu-Daud\xE9 et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",Year:"2018",Authors:"Mathieu-Daud\xE9, F., Claverie, A., Plichart, C., Boulanger, D., Mphande, F.A., Bossin, H.C.",Journal:"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"12(7)",Pages:"e0006660","Work Location":["French Polynesia"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3242_Matthieu-Daude_et_al_2018_PLOS_NTDs_Specific-human-antibody-responses-to-Aedes-aegypti-and-Aedes-polynesiensis-saliva.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3243",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"The history of bancroftian lymphatic filariasis in Australasia and Oceania: Is there a threat of re-occurrence in mainland Australia?",Description:"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) infects an estimated 120 million people worldwide, with a further 856 million considered at risk of infection and requiring preventative chemotherapy.

Human immigration to Australia from LF-endemic countries, including those close to Australia, and the presence of susceptible mosquitoes that can act as suitable vectors, heighten the possibility of the reintroduction of LF into this country. In this review, we examine the history of LF in Australia and Oceania and weigh up the potential risk of its re-occurrence on mainland Australia. \xA9 2018 by the authors.",Year:"2018",Authors:"Gordon, C.A., Jones, M.K., McManus, D.P.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"3(2)",Pages:"58","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3243_Gordon_et_al_TMID_HIstory_of_LF_Australia_tropicalmed-03-00058_(2).pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3244",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Understanding heterogeneities in mosquito-bite exposure and infection distributions for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis",Description:"It is well known that individuals in the same community can be exposed to a highly variable number of mosquito bites. This heterogeneity in bite exposure has consequences for the control of vector-borne diseases because a few people may be contributing significantly to transmission. However, very few studies measure sources of heterogeneity in a way which is relevant to decision-making. We investigate the relationship between two classic measures of heterogeneity, spatial and individual, within the context of lymphatic filariasis, a parasitic mosquito-borne disease. Using infection and mosquito-bite data for five villages in Papua New Guinea, we measure biting characteristics to model what impact bed-nets have had on control of the disease. We combine this analysis with geospatial modelling to understand the spatial relationship between disease indicators and nightly mosquito bites. We found a weak association between biting and infection heterogeneity within villages. The introduction of bed-nets increased biting heterogeneity, but the reduction in mean biting more than compensated for this, by reducing prevalence closer to elimination thresholds. Nightly biting was explained by a spatial heterogeneity model, while parasite load was better explained by an individual heterogeneity model. Spatial and individual heterogeneity are qualitatively different with profoundly different policy implications. \xA9 2018 The Author(s).",Year:"2018",Authors:"Irvine, M.A., Kazura, J.W., Hollingsworth, T.D., Reimer, L.J.",Journal:"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"285(1871)",Pages:"20172253","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3244_Irvine_et_al_2018_PROC_ROY_SOC_LOND_B_Understanding-heterogeneities-in-mosquitobite-exposure-and-infection-distributions-for-the-elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3245",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Zika virus outbreak in the Pacific: Vector competence of regional vectors",Description:"Background: In 2013, Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in French Polynesia and spread through the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. Several potential Aedes mosquitoes may have contributed to the ZIKV transmission including Aedes aegypti, the main arbovirus vector in the region, and Aedes polynesiensis, vector of lymphatic filariasis and secondary vector of dengue virus. The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of these two Pacific vectors to transmit ZIKV at a regional scale, through the evaluation and comparison of the vector competence of wild Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis populations from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain which circulated in this region during the 2013\u20132017 outbreak. Methodology/principal findings: Field Ae. aegypti (three populations) and Ae. polynesiensis (two populations) from the Pacific region were collected for this study. Female mosquitoes were orally exposed to ZIKV (107TCID50/mL) isolated in the region in 2014. At 6, 9, 14 and 21 days post-infection, mosquito bodies (thorax and abdomen), heads and saliva were analyzed to measure infection, dissemination, transmission rates and transmission efficiency, respectively. According to our results, ZIKV infection rates were heterogeneous between the Ae. aegypti populations, but the dissemination rates were moderate and more homogenous between these populations. For Ae. polynesiensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between the two populations tested. The transmission rate and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study. Conclusion/significance: Our results indicated a low ZIKV transmission by Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis tested from the Pacific region. These results were unexpected and suggest the importance of other factors especially the vector density, the mosquito lifespan or the large immunologically naive fraction of the population that may have contributed to the rapid spread of the ZIKV in the Pacific region during the 2013\u20132017 outbreak. \xA9 2018 Calvez et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",Year:"2018",Authors:"Calvez, E., Mousson, L., Vazeille, M., O\u2019Connor, O., Cao-Lormeau, V-M., Mathieu-Daud\xE9, F., Pocquet, N., Failloux, A-B., Dupont-Rouzeyrol, M.",Journal:"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"12(7)",Pages:"e0006637","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3245_Calvez_et_al_PLOS_NTDs_Zika-virus-outbreak-in-the-Pacific-Vector-competence-of-regional-vectorsPLoS-Neglected-Tropical-Diseases.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3246",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"A Synthetic Population for Modelling the Dynamics of Infectious Disease Transmission in American Samoa",Description:"Agent-based modelling is a useful approach for capturing heterogeneity in disease transmission.

Considerable attempts to eliminate the disease had occurred in the Pacific region by the year 2003, and the prevalence in FSM was thought to be sufficiently low that the region was considered non-endemic. However, a survey conducted in 2003 on an isolated atoll of FSM, Satawal Island, challenged that assumption. Methods: Participants on Satawal Island were recruited and their blood tested for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen by the filariasis immunochromatographic test (ICT) card and circulating microfilaria by Knott's concentration technique. A survey for active cases of lymphoedema, elephantiasis and hydrocoele was performed and mosquitoes were trapped and dissected to detect larvae of W. bancrofti. Results: A total of 104 males and 149 females from early teens to mid-80s were tested. Men had a significantly higher prevalence of infection than women in both the ICT test (53 vs 28%; p < 0.001) and by Knott's concentration results (37 vs 11%; p < 0.001). Microfilaria prevalence was higher in subjects \u226425 than in those >25 years of age. All persons sampled were treated for LF. No cases of elephantiasis or hydrocoele were detected. No Aedes dissected were positive but three of nine culicine mosquitoes were positive for L1-3 larval stages of W. bancrofti by microscopy. In depth interviews were conducted with residents and chiefs. Conclusions: This survey showed that even in regions thought to be close to elimination, isolated high intensity foci of lymphatic filariasis may occur. These need to be recognized and control measures instituted such as local MDA as in the current study. \xA9 2017 The Author(s).",Year:"2017",Authors:"Pretrick, M., Melrose, W., Chaine, J-P., Canyon, D., Carron, J., Graves, P.M., Bradbury, R.S.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"45(1)",Pages:"17","Work Location":["Federated States of Micronesia"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3248_Pretrick_et_al_2017_TROP_MED_HEALTH_LF_in_Satawal,_FSM_2003_s41182-017-0050-0.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3249",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Impact of the Lymphatic Filariasis Control Program towards elimination of filariasis in Vanuatu, 1997-2006",Description:"Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. The filarial worms affect the lymphatic system which leads to abnormal enlargement of body parts, chronic pain, disability, and social discrimination. In 1999, a commitment was made to eliminate LF from the Pacific Region by 2010. The Pacific Program to Eliminate LF began, with Vanuatu being one of the 16 endemic countries included in this program. Methods: In 1997/1998 a LF prevalence baseline survey was conducted to determine the need for mass drug administration (MDA) in Vanuatu. In 1999, the Vanuatu Lymphatic Filariasis Control Program was established, and nationwide MDA was implemented from 2000 to 2004. LF prevalence was collected during the MDA through sentinel site and spot check surveys, and after 5 years of MDA. MDA implementation methods included health worker training, social mobilization, and culturally appropriate health promotion strategies. Results: LF prevalence at baseline was 4.79%; after MDA this declined to 0.16% in 2005/2006. Average MDA coverage ranged from 75.5-81.5% across 5 years. All three evaluation units surveyed in 2005/2006 were below the 1% threshold required to stop MDA. Conclusions: The LF Control Program between 1997 and 2006 was successful in reducing LF prevalence to <1%. High MDA coverage was a critical component of this success. This period of the Vanuatu LF Control Program played an important role in helping to eliminate LF in Vanuatu. \xA9 2017 The Author(s).",Year:"2017",Authors:"Allen, T., Taleo, F., Graves, P.M., Wood, P., Taleo, G., Baker, M.C., Bradley, M., Ichimori, K.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"45(1)",Pages:"8","Work Location":["Vanuatu"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3249_Allen_et_al_2017_TMAH_Vanuatu_paper_1_s41182-017-0047-8.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3250",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Measuring changes in transmission of neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and enteric pathogens from quantitative antibody levels",Description:"Background: Serological antibody levels are a sensitive marker of pathogen exposure, and advances in multiplex assays have created enormous potential for large-scale, integrated infectious disease surveillance. Most methods to analyze antibody measurements reduce quantitative antibody levels to seropositive and seronegative groups, but this can be difficult for many pathogens and may provide lower resolution information than quantitative levels. Analysis methods have predominantly maintained a single disease focus, yet integrated surveillance platforms would benefit from methodologies that work across diverse pathogens included in multiplex assays. Methods/Principal findings: We developed an approach to measure changes in transmission from quantitative antibody levels that can be applied to diverse pathogens of global importance. We compared age-dependent immunoglobulin G curves in repeated cross-sectional surveys between populations with differences in transmission for multiple pathogens, including: lymphatic filariasis (Wuchereria bancrofti) measured before and after mass drug administration on Mauke, Cook Islands, malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) before and after a combined insecticide and mass drug administration intervention in the Garki project, Nigeria, and enteric protozoans (Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba histolytica), bacteria (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.), and viruses (norovirus groups I and II) in children living in Haiti and the USA. Age-dependent antibody curves fit with ensemble machine learning followed a characteristic shape across pathogens that aligned with predictions from basic mechanisms of humoral immunity. Differences in pathogen transmission led to shifts in fitted antibody curves that were remarkably consistent across pathogens, assays, and populations. Mean antibody levels correlated strongly with traditional measures of transmission intensity, such as the entomological inoculation rate for P. falciparum (Spearman\u2019s rho = 0.75). In both high- and low transmission settings, mean antibody curves revealed changes in population mean antibody levels that were masked by seroprevalence measures because changes took place above or below the seropositivity cutoff. Conclusions/Significance: Age-dependent antibody curves and summary means provided a robust and sensitive measure of changes in transmission, with greatest sensitivity among young children. The method generalizes to pathogens that can be measured in high-throughput, multiplex serological assays, and scales to surveillance activities that require high spatiotemporal resolution. Our results suggest quantitative antibody levels will be particularly useful to measure differences in exposure for pathogens that elicit a transient antibody response or for monitoring populations with very high- or very low transmission, when seroprevalence is less informative. The approach represents a new opportunity to conduct integrated serological surveillance for neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and other infectious diseases with well-defined antigen targets. \xA9 2017 Public Library of Science.

Host selection also affects the outcome of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN). Despite the recent nationwide implementation of LLIN-based malaria control program in Papua New Guinea (PNG), little is known about the host selection of the local Anopheles vectors. This study investigated the host selection of Anopheles vectors in PNG. Methods: Blood-engorged mosquitoes were sampled using the barrier screen method and blood meals analyzed for vertebrate host source with PCR-amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Abundance of common hosts was estimated in surveys. The test of homogeneity of proportions and the Manly resource selection ratio were used to determine if hosts were selected in proportion to their abundance. Results: Two thousand four hundred and forty blood fed Anopheles females of seven species were sampled from five villages in Madang, PNG. Of 2,142 samples tested, 2,061 (96.2%) yielded a definitive host source; all were human, pig, or dog. Hosts were not selected in proportion to their abundance, but rather were under-selected or over-selected by the mosquitoes. Four species, Anopheles farauti (sensu stricto) (s.s.), Anopheles punctulatus (s.s.), Anopheles farauti no. 4 and Anopheles longirostris, over-selected humans in villages with low LLIN usage, but over-selected pigs in villages with high LLIN usage. Anopheles koliensis consistently over-selected humans despite high LLIN usage, and Anopheles bancroftii over-selected pigs. Conclusions: The plasticity of host selection of an Anopheles species depends on its opportunistic, anthropophilic or zoophilic behavior, and on the extent of host availability and LLIN usage where the mosquitoes forage for hosts. The high anthropophily of An. koliensis increases the likelihood of contacting the LLIN inside houses. This allows its population size to be reduced to levels insufficient to support transmission. In contrast, by feeding on alternative hosts the likelihood of the opportunistic species to contact LLIN is lower, making them difficult to control. By maintaining high population size, the proportion that feed on humans outdoors can sustain residual transmission despite high LLIN usage in the village. \xA9 2017 The Author(s).",Year:"2017",Authors:"Keven, J.B., Reimer, L., Katusele, M., Koimbu, G., Vinit, R., Vincent, N., Thomsen, E., Foran, D.R., Zimmerman, P.A., Walker, E.D.",Journal:"Parasites and Vectors",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"10(1)",Pages:"95","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3252_Keven-2017-Plasticity_of_host_selection_by_mal.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3253",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Predicting lymphatic filariasis transmission and elimination dynamics using a multi-model ensemble framework",Description:"Mathematical models of parasite transmission provide powerful tools for assessing the impacts of interventions. Owing to complexity and uncertainty, no single model may capture all features of transmission and elimination dynamics. Multi-model ensemble modelling offers a framework to help overcome biases of single models. We report on the development of a first multi-model ensemble of three lymphatic filariasis (LF) models (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, and TRANSFIL), and evaluate its predictive performance in comparison with that of the constituents using calibration and validation data from three case study sites, one each from the three major LF endemic regions: Africa, Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). We assessed the performance of the respective models for predicting the outcomes of annual MDA strategies for various baseline scenarios thought to exemplify the current endemic conditions in the three regions. The results show that the constructed multi-model ensemble outperformed the single models when evaluated across all sites. Single models that best fitted calibration data tended to do less well in simulating the out-of-sample, or validation, intervention data. Scenario modelling results demonstrate that the multi-model ensemble is able to compensate for variance between single models in order to produce more plausible predictions of intervention impacts. Our results highlight the value of an ensemble approach to modelling parasite control dynamics. However, its optimal use will require further methodological improvements as well as consideration of the organizational mechanisms required to ensure that modelling results and data are shared effectively between all stakeholders. \xA9 2017 The Authors",Year:"2017",Authors:"Smith, M.E., Singh, B.K., Irvine, M.A., Stolk, W.A., Subramanian, S., Hollingsworth, T.D., Michael, E.",Journal:"Epidemics",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"18",Pages:"16-28","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3253_Smith_et_al_2017_EPIDEMICS_Multi_model_LF_transmission_-s2.0-S1755436516300615.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3254",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Surveillance efforts after mass drug administration to validate elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in Vanuatu",Description:"Background: Vanuatu was formerly highly endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF), caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. After a baseline survey showing 4.8% antigen prevalence in 1998, the country conducted nationwide (in one implementation unit) annual mass drug administration (MDA) with albendazole and diethylcarbamazine citrate from 2000 to 2004 and achieved prevalence of 0.2% by 2006 in a representative nationwide cluster survey among all age groups. Methods: Post MDA surveillance was conducted from 2006 to 2012. After MDA, the country was divided for surveillance into three evaluation units (EUs) formed by grouping provinces according to baseline prevalence: EU1: Torba, Sanma and Malampa; EU2: Penama; EU3: Shefa and Tafea. The study compiled all past data and information on surveys in Vanuatu from the country programme. This paper reviews the surveillance activities done after stopping MDA to validate the interruption of transmission and elimination of LF as a public health problem. Results: Post-MDA surveillance consisting of at least three transmission assessment surveys (TAS) in each of the three EUs was conducted between 2006 and 2012. Sentinel and spot check surveys identified a few villages with persistent high prevalence; all antigen positive cases in these sites were treated and additional targeted MDA conducted for 3 years in 13 villages in one area of concern. All three EUs passed all TAS in 2007, 2010 and 2012 respectively, with no positives found except in EU2 (Penama province) in 2012 when 2 children tested positive for circulating filariasis antigen. Assessment of the burden of chronic filariasis morbidity found 95 cases in 2003 and 32 remaining cases in 2007, all aged over 60 years. Conclusions: Vanuatu has achieved validation of elimination of LF as a public health problem. Post-validation surveillance is still recommended especially in formerly highly endemic areas. \xA9 2017 The Author(s).",Year:"2017",Authors:"Taleo, F., Taleo, G., Graves, P.M., Wood, P., Kim, S.H., Ozaki, M., Joseph, H., Chu, B., Pavluck, A., Yajima, A., Melrose, W., Ichimori, K., Capuano, C.",Journal:"Tropical Medicine and Health",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"45(1)",Pages:"18","Work Location":["Vanuatu"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3254_Taleo_et_al-2017-Tropical_Medicine_and_Health_Surveillance_efforts_after_MDA_Vanuatu.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3255",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Cutaneous Manifestations of Selected Parasitic Infections in Western Pacific and Southeast Asian Regions",Description:"Cutaneous manifestations of parasitic infections often result in discomfort, debilitation, and even stigmatization.

However, despite the advances made in instituting large-scale MDA programs in affected countries, a challenge to meeting the goal of global eradication is the heterogeneous transmission of LF across endemic regions, and the impact that such complexity may have on the effort required to interrupt transmission in all socioecological settings. Methods: Here, we apply a Bayesian computer simulation procedure to fit transmission models of LF to field data assembled from 18 sites across the major LF endemic regions of Africa, Asia and Papua New Guinea, reflecting different ecological and vector characteristics, to investigate the impacts and implications of transmission heterogeneity and complexity on filarial infection dynamics, system robustness and control. Results: We find firstly that LF elimination thresholds varied significantly between the 18 study communities owing to site variations in transmission and initial ecological parameters. We highlight how this variation in thresholds lead to the need for applying variable durations of interventions across endemic communities for achieving LF elimination; however, a major new result is the finding that filarial population responses to interventions ultimately reflect outcomes of interplays between dynamics and the biological architectures and processes that generate robustness/fragility trade-offs in parasite transmission. Intervention simulations carried out in this study further show how understanding these factors is also key to the design of options that would effectively eliminate LF from all settings. In this regard, we find how including vector control into MDA programs may not only offer a countermeasure that will reliably increase system fragility globally across all settings and hence provide a control option robust to differential locality-specific transmission dynamics, but by simultaneously reducing transmission regime variability also permit more reliable macroscopic predictions of intervention effects. Conclusions: Our results imply that a new approach, combining adaptive modelling of parasite transmission with the use of biological robustness as a design principle, is required if we are to both enhance understanding of complex parasitic infections and delineate options to facilitate their elimination effectively. \xA9 2016 Michael and Singh.",Year:"2016",Authors:"Michael, E., Singh, B.K.",Journal:"BMC Medicine",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"14(1)",Pages:"14","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3257_Michael_Singh_2016_BMC_MED_Heterogeneous_dynamics_modeling_s12916-016-0557-y.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3258",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Historic accounts of Mansonella parasitaemias in the South Pacific and their relevance to lymphatic filariasis elimination efforts today",Description:"There are two species of filarial parasites with sheathless microfilariae known to commonly cause parasitaemias in humans: Mansonella perstans and Mansonella ozzardi. In most contemporary accounts of the distribution of these parasites, neither is usually considered to occur anywhere in the Eastern Hemisphere. However, Sir Patrick Manson, who first described both parasite species, recorded the existence of sheathless sharp-tailed Mansonella ozzardi-like parasites occurring in the blood of natives from New Guinea in each and every version of his manual for tropical disease that he wrote before his death in 1922. Manson's reports were based on his own identifications and were made from at least two independent blood sample collections that were taken from the island. Pacific region Mansonella perstans parasitaemias were also later (in 1923) reported to occur in New Guinea and once before this (in 1905) in Fiji. Although Mansonella-parasitaemias are generally regarded as benign, they are thought to be of public health importance because they can affect the epidemiological monitoring of other filarial diseases. In this article, we reviewed the historic literature concerning Pacific-origin Mansonella-parasitaemias in an attempt to explain how, despite repeated reports of Pacific-region Mansonella-parasitaemias, by as early as the 1970s, the WHO had arrived at the present-day view that Wuchereria bancrofti is the only cause of filarial parasitaemias in Papua New Guinea. We have also evaluated the evidence supporting the contemporary existence of Pacific-area parasitaemia-causing Mansonella parasites and assessed the relevance such parasites could have for present-day lymphatic filariasis elimination efforts in the region. \xA9 2016 Hainan Medical College.",Year:"2016",Authors:"Crainey, J.L., Ribeiro da Silva, T.R., Luz, S.L.B.",Journal:"Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"9(3)",Pages:"205-210","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3258_Crainey_et_al_2016_ASIAN_PACIFIC_J_TROP_MED_Mansonella_in_S_Pacific_1-s2.0-S1995764516000419-main.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3259",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination in American Samoa: Evaluation of Molecular Xenomonitoring as a Surveillance Tool in the Endgame",Description:"The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis has made significant progress toward interrupting transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF) through mass drug administration (MDA). Operational challenges in defining endpoints of elimination programs include the need to determine appropriate post-MDA surveillance strategies. As humans are the only reservoirs of LF parasites, one such strategy is molecular xenomonitoring (MX), the detection of filarial DNA in mosquitoes using molecular methods (PCR), to provide an indirect indicator of infected persons nearby. MX could potentially be used to evaluate program success, provide support for decisions to stop MDA, and conduct post-MDA surveillance. American Samoa has successfully completed MDA and passed WHO recommended Transmission Assessment Surveys in 2011 and 2015, but recent studies using spatial analysis of antigen (Ag) and antibody (Ab) prevalence in adults (aged \u226518 years) and entomological surveys showed evidence of possible ongoing transmission. This study evaluated MX as a surveillance tool in American Samoa by linking village-level results of published human and mosquito studies. Of 32 villages, seropositive persons for Og4C3 Ag were identified in 11 (34.4%), for Wb123 Ab in 18 (56.3%) and for Bm14 Ab in 27 (84.4%) of villages.

W. bancrofti currently infects over 90 million people throughout the tropics and has been acknowledged by the world health organization as a vulnerable parasite. Current research has focused primarily on the clinical manifestations of disease and little is known about the evolutionary history of W. bancrofti. To improve upon knowledge of the evolutionary history of W. bancrofti, we whole genome sequenced 13 W. bancrofti larvae. We circumvent many of the difficulties of multiple infections by sampling larvae directly from mosquitoes that were experimentally inoculated with infected blood. To begin, we used whole genome data to reconstruct the historical population size. Our results support a history of fluctuating population sizes that can be correlated with human migration and fluctuating mosquito abundances. Next, we reconstructed the putative pedigree of W. bancrofti worms within an infection using the kinship coefficient. We deduced that there are full-sib and half-sib relationships residing within the same larval cohort. Through combined analysis of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes we concluded that this is likely a results of polyandrous mating, the first time reported for W. bancrofti. Lastly, we scanned the genomes for signatures of natural selection. Annotation of putative selected regions identified proteins that may have aided in a parasitic life style or may have evolved to protect against current drug treatments. We discuss our results in the greater context of understanding the biology of an animal with a unique life history and ecology. \xA9 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Year:"2016",Authors:"Small, S.T., Reimer, L.J., Tisch, D.J., King, C.L., Christensen, B.M., Siba, P.M., Kazura, J.W., Serre, D., Zimmerman, P.A.",Journal:"Molecular Ecology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"25(7)",Pages:"1465-1477","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13574",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"3261",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Short communication: Epidemiological assessment of Strongyloides stercoralis in Fijian children",Description:"As a part of the lymphatic filariasis (LF) transmission assessment survey (TAS)/soil-transmitted helminths (STH) prevalence survey in Western Division of Fiji, a pilot screen for Strongyloides stercoralis (SS) in school children was undertaken using a combination of the Baermann concentration (BC) method and real-time PCR assays. Using BC, faecal samples collected from 111 children of 7 schools were examined. A single child was positive for larvae of SS and underwent a clinical examination finding an asymptomatic infection.

Currently, the only supplementary tool recommended by the World Health Organization is larval source management (LSM). The feasibility and potential effectiveness of LSM requires information on the distribution of anophelines, the productivity of larval habitats and the potential impacts of larval control on adult fitness.

Methods: The distribution of anophelines in Central and Western Provinces in the Solomon Islands was mapped from cross-sectional larval habitat surveys. The composition and micro-distribution of larval instars within a large permanent river-mouth lagoon was examined with a longitudinal survey. Density-dependent regulation of An. farauti larvae was investigated by longitudinally following the development and survival of different densities of first instars in floating cages in a river-mouth lagoon.

Results: Five anopheline species were molecularly identified from a range of fresh and brackish water habitats: An. farauti s.s., An. hinesorum, An. lungae, An. nataliae and An. solomonis. The most common habitats used by the primary malaria vector, An. farauti, were coastal lagoons and swamps. In the detailed study of lagoon micro-productivity, An. farauti was non-uniformly distributed with highest densities found at collections sites most proximal and distal to the mouth of the lagoon. The survival of An. farauti larvae was more than twofold lower when larvae were held at the highest experimental density (1 larva per 3.8 cm2) when compared with the lowest density (1 larva per 38 cm2).

Conclusions: The only documented major malaria vector collected in larval surveys in both Central and Western Provinces was An. farauti. Lagoons and swamps, the most common, largest and (potentially) most productive larval sites of this malaria vector, were \u201Cfew, fixed and findable\u201D and theoretically, therefore, amenable to successful LSM. However, the immense scale and complexity of these ecosystems in which An. farauti larvae are found raises questions regarding the ability to effectively control the larvae, as incomplete larviciding could trigger density dependent effects resulting in increased larval survivorship. While LSM has the potential to significantly contribute to malaria control of this early and outdoor biting vector, more information on the distribution of larvae within these extensive habitats is required to maximize the effectiveness of LSM.`,Year:"2016",Authors:"Russell, T.L., Burkot, T.R., Bugoro, H., Apairamo, A., Beebe, N.W., Chow, W.K., Cooper, R.D., Collins, F.H., Lobo, N.F.",Journal:"Malaria Journal",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"15(1)",Pages:"1-9","Work Location":["Solomon Islands"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3266_Russell_et_al_2016_MAL_J_Larval_habitats_of_the_Anopheles_farauti_and_Anopheles_lungae_complexes_in_the_Solomon_Islands.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3267",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"The mosquitoes of Polynesia with a pictorial key to some species associated with Filariasis and/or Dengue fever",Description:"A list of the mosquitoes of Polynesia is tabulated and their distribution outlined.

The interest and richness of this study lies in the fact that the author worked for twelve years in a geographically isolated and highly fragmented region of the world: French Polynesia. This territory covers an area comparable to that of Europe and consists of about 178 islands. Depending on whether one works in the archipelagos of the Society, the Marquesas, the Australs, the Tuamotu or the Gambiers, one encounters, in each, specific situations both from the point of view of morphology (high islands, atolis) and climate, flora, fauna and human population. In addition, the vagaries of 35 years of mass prophylaxis with the help of a drug, diethylcarbamazine, undertaken by public health to eradicate the disease, has fragmented the territory into a mosaic of different epidemiological situations. The author presents the results of comparative work on the biology and dynamics of populations by studying the laying, larvae, nymphs and adult mosquitoes, the action of various natural predators and larvae, the ecology of the populations of parasitic worm larvae in mosquitoes and humans.

The phylogeny generated by the electrophoretic data was generally in agreement with morphological classifications except that one morphologically distinct species pair (A. alcasidi and A. malayensis) showed only populational differentiation and several nearly identical morphological pairs in Polynesia (e.g., A. pseudoscutellaris and A. polynesiensis) were very distant genetically.

A molecular clock, based on the ratio between genetic distance and divergence time (one unit of Nei's distance = 11 million years) inferred from a dated geologic event, was used to compare zoogeography, morphology, and biochemical relationships. Genetic distances between species from the Solomon Islands and the Vanuatu-Polynesia area correspond to an early Pliocene separation of these areas. An invasion of Micronesia occurred approximately 5 million years ago. Most remaining speciation occurred during the mid-Pliocene as islands moved into their present-day positions. The close relationship between southeast Asian and Philippine species could have resulted from the recent onset of isolation in the Pleistocene.

Interspecific hybridization potential was not significantly correlated with Nei's genetic distance. Many quite distantly related species readily hybridize, while some closely related pairs show only unidirectional compatibility. Slight interspecific morphological divergence and the independence of hybridization capabilities from phylogeny are not unexpected in a group in which species are allopatric and occupy similar habitats.`,Year:"1985",Authors:"Pashley, D.P., Rai, K.S., Pashley, D.N.",Journal:"Evolution",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"5",Pages:"985-997","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3272",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea and the Threat of its Introduction to Australia",Description:"In the Western Province of Papua New Guinea populations of the dengue vector Aedes albopicrus were found in Daru and Kiunga, but not in three coastal villages opposite the Torres Strait Islands.

This plan provides guidance for all aspects mosquito surveillance and control (i.e., mosquito collecting, species identification, pathogen testing, vector control, insecticide resistance monitoring, and public outreach).

A mark-release-recapture experiment addressed whether host preference in a population of Anopheles farauti was uniform or if there were anthropophilic and zoophilic subpopulations. The corresponding fitness associated with selecting different hosts for blood meals was compared by measuring fecundity.

Methods: The attractiveness of humans for blood meals by An. farauti in the Solomon Islands was compared to pigs using tent traps. Host fidelity was assessed by mark-release-recapture experiments in which different colour dusts were linked to the host to which the mosquito was first attracted. Outdoor resting An. farauti were captured on barrier screens and the human blood index (HBI) as well as the feeding index were calculated. The fecundity of individual An. farauti after feeding on either humans or pigs was assessed from blood-fed mosquitoes held in individual oviposition chambers.

Results: Anopheles farauti were more attracted to humans than pigs at a ratio of 1.31:1.00. The mark-release-recapture experiment found evidence for An. farauti being a single population regarding host preference. The HBI of outdoor resting An. farauti was 0.93 and the feeding index was 1.29. Anopheles farauti that fed on a human host laid more eggs but had a longer oviposition time compared to An. farauti that had blood fed on a pig.

Conclusions: One of the strongest drivers for host species preference was the relative abundance of the different host species. Here, An. farauti have a slight preference for humans over pigs as blood meal sources. However, the limited availability of alternative hosts relative to humans in the Solomon Islands ensures a very high proportion of blood meals are obtained from humans, and thus, the transmission potential of malaria by An. farauti is high.`,Year:"2016",Authors:"Russell, T.L., Beebe, N.W., Bugoro, H., Apairamo, A., Cooper, R.D., Collins, F.H., Lobo, N.F., Burkot, T.R.",Journal:"Malaria Journal",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"15(1)",Pages:"1-9","Work Location":["Solomon Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3286",Category:"Books",Title:"Medical Entomology studies XII: A revision of the Aedea scutellaris group of Tonga (Diptera: Culicisae)",Description:"This revision of the Aedes scutellaris group of Tonga is based on the examination of more than 9,000 specimens (including 1,866 individual rearings with associated pupal and/or larval skins) of 3 species and one subspecies.

Since there seems to be no environmental factor involved in rendering the breeding places unsuitable for A. guamensis, the reduction in A. guamensis populations may be, in part, the result of competition from A. albopictus.",Year:"1972",Authors:"Rozeboom, L.E., Bridges, J.R.",Journal:"Bulletin of the World Health Organization",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"46(4)",Pages:"477-483","Work Location":["Guam"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3291_BWHO_Rozeboom_et_al_1972_Relative_population_densities_of_Aedes_albopictus_and_A._guamensis_on_Guam.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3292",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"The punctulatus complex of Anopheles (diptera: culicidae)",Description:"Not avaliable",Year:"1946",Authors:"Rozeboom, L.E., Knight, K.L.,",Journal:"The Journal of Parasitology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"32(2)",Pages:"95-131","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3293",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Differential ecology of Anopheles punctulatus and three members of the Anopheles farauti complex of mosquitoes on Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, identified by PCR-RFLP analysis",Description:"From a series of larval collections made across northern Guadalcanal during the dry season, October\u2013November 1997, four members of the Anopheles punctulatus group of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were identified using PCR-RFLP analysis.

In the Pacific, the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases has been increasing in recent years. The Kingdom of Tonga has had numerous disease outbreaks from dengue fever and chikungunya viruses over recent years. Previous research has catalogued mosquito species occurrences and distributions throughout Tonga. However, it is unknown whether new species have arrived in Tonga, and if distribution of previously found species has changed since the last comprehensive survey in 2006. Consequently, we conducted a mosquito larval survey between November and December 2013 at 84 sites across four islands (Tongatapu, Pangaimotu, 'Oneata and 'Eua) in the Tongatapu Island Group to record the distribution and occurrence of mosquito larvae. Larvae were more frequently collected in artificial (e.g. abandoned car tyres, 55-gallon plastic drums and plastic containers) than natural (e.g. pools, ponds and tree holes) habitats. Larvae of nine mosquito species were collected in the Tongatapu Island Group: Aedes aegypti, A.\u2009albopictus, A.\u2009tongae, A.\u2009horrescens, A.\u2009vexans nocturnus, Culex annulirostris, C. albinervis, C.\u2009quinquefasciatus and C.\u2009sitiens.

Aedes aegypti, A.albopictus and C.\u2009quinquefasciatus were the three most common species collected and have markedly increased their distribution since the 2006 survey. The collection of A. albopictus is the second time that this species has been recorded in Tonga; however, the spatial extent of this species throughout Tongatapu was far greater than previously recorded.

Humans living close to these wetlands express concerns about future mosquito nuisance situations, and request the necessary distance between human occupation and wetlands to avoid such problems. Wetland managers need to know the distance required, as well as the type of management needed for such buffer or barrier zones. Here we performed an extensive literature survey to collect quantitative information on mosquito flight distance and the relevant environmental conditions. Mosquitoes have an average maximum flight distance of between 50 m and 50 km, depending on the species. Long-distance or migratory flights are strongly related to species ecological preferences and physiology, are survived by few specimens, and do not relate to nuisance situations. Nuisance-related or non-oriented flights are also species-specific and cover much shorter distances-between 25 m and 6 km for the 23 species analyzed. Based on these results, we made regression-based estimations of the percentages of the population that cross certain distances. A 90% reduction in breeding site population density would require minimal distances of 56 m for Anopheles saperoi and 8.6 km for Anopheles sinensis, and much greater distances for Aedes vexans, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culiseta morsitans. Little useful information was available regarding the environmental conditions under which non-oriented flights took place. Qualitatively, the review showed that flight capacity was influenced by landscape structure, meteorological conditions (temperature, humidity, and illumination), and species physiology (energy available for flight). Overall, our findings suggest that predictions regarding the construction of barrier zones around breeding sites can be made based on mosquito and host density and human nuisance perception, and that barrier zone usefulness strongly depends on the mosquito species involved.

In 2009, Santa Isabel Province in the Solomon Islands embarked on a malaria elimination programme. However, very little is known in the Province about the anopheline fauna, which species are vectors, their bionomics and how they may respond to intensified intervention measures. The purpose of this study was to provide baseline data on the malaria vectors and to ascertain the possibility of successfully eliminating malaria using the existing conventional vector control measures, such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN).

Methods
Entomological surveys were undertaken during October 2009. To determine species composition and distribution larval surveys were conducted across on the whole island. For malaria transmission studies, adult anophelines were sampled using human landing catches from two villages - one coastal and one inland.

Results
Five Anopheles species were found on Santa Isabel: Anopheles farauti, Anopheles hinesorum, Anopheles lungae, Anopheles solomonis, and Anopheles nataliae. Anopheles hinesorum was the most widespread species. Anopheles farauti was abundant, but found only on the coast. Anopheles punctulatus and Anopheles koliensis were not found. Anopheles farauti was the only species found biting in the coastal village, it was incriminated as a vector in this study; it fed early in the night but equally so indoors and outdoors, and had a low survival rate. Anopheles solomonis was the main species biting humans in the inland village, it was extremely exophagic, with low survival rates, and readily fed on pigs.

Conclusion
The disappearance of the two major vectors, An. punctulatus and An. koliensis, from Santa Isabel and the predominance of An. hinesorum, a non-vector species may facilitate malaria elimination measures. Anopheles farauti was identified as the main coastal vector with An. solomonis as a possible inland vector. The behaviour of An. solomonis is novel as it has not been previously found biting humans in any numbers. Both species appear to be short-lived, a characteristic that will limit their transmission potential. The early night feeding behaviour and a degree of outdoor biting seen in An. farauti and particularly in An. solomonis will require that their response to IRS and LLIN be closely monitored. In coastal villages, where large, favourable breeding sites allow for high numbers of An. farauti may require the addition of larval control to achieve elimination.`,Year:"2011",Authors:"Bugoro, H., Iro'ofa, C., Mackenzie, D.O., Apairamo, A., Hevalao, W., Corcoran, S., Bobogare, A., Beebe, N.W., Russell, T.L., Chen, C.C., Cooper, R.D.",Journal:"Malaria Journal",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"10(1)",Pages:"1-11","Work Location":["Solomon Islands"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3305_Mal_J_Bugoro_et_al_2011_Changes_in_vector_species_composition,_biology_and_behaviour_will_favour_malaria_elimination_in_Solomon_Islands.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3306",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Mosquitoes of Guam and the Northern Marianas: distribution, checklists, and notes on mosquito-borne pathogens",Description:`This report includes the distribution records and updated checklists of the mosquitoes known to occur in Guam and

Behavioral resilience in mosquitoes poses a significant challenge to mosquito control. Although behavior changes in anopheline vectors have been reported over the last decade, there are no empirical data to suggest they compromise the efficacy of vector control in reducing malaria transmission.

Methods.
In this study, we quantified human exposure to both bites and infective bites of a major malaria vector in Papua New Guinea over the course of 4 years surrounding nationwide bednet distribution. We also quantified malaria infection prevalence in the human population during the same time period.

Results.
We observed a shift in mosquito biting to earlier hours of the evening, before individuals are indoors and protected by bednets, followed by a return to preintervention biting rates. As a result, net users and non\u2013net users experienced higher levels of transmission than before the intervention. The personal protection provided by a bednet decreased over the study period and was lowest in the adult population, who may be an important reservoir for transmission. Malaria prevalence decreased in only 1 of 3 study villages after the distribution.

Discussion.
This study highlights the necessity of validating and deploying vector control measures targeting outdoor exposure to control and eliminate malaria.`,Year:"2017",Authors:"Thomsen, E.K., Koimbu, G., Pulford, J., Jamea-Maiasa, S., Ura, Y., Keven, J.B., Siba, P.M., Mueller, I., Hetzel, M.W., Reimer, L.J.",Journal:"The Journal of Infectious Diseases",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"215(5)",Pages:"790-797","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3314",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"RELATION OF AGE, SEX, AND MICROFILARIA DENSITY TO TREATMENT OF SUB-PERIODIC FILARIASIS WITH DIETHYLCARBAMAZINE OF SUB-PERIODIC FILARIASIS WITH DIETHYLCARBAMAZINE",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1967",Authors:"Ciferri, F.E., Kessel, J.F.",Journal:"The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"16(3)",Pages:"321-328","Work Location":["American Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.1967.16.321",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"3315",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"ENQUETE EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE ET ENTOMOLOGIQUE SUR LA FILARIOSE DE ,BANCROFT EN NOUVELLE-CALEDONIE ET DEPENDANCES",Description:"From a survey carried out during 1955 and 1956 the authors outline the clinical, parasitological and entomological aspects of bancroftian filariasis in New Caledonia and Dependencies.

They are constituted by a sinuous tunnel leading to a chamber in contact with the water table, where mosquito larvae proliferate. Controlling larvae in these sites is difficult, because the configuration of burrows prevents the use of standard techniques. An experiment was carried out in French Polynesia to control Aedes polynesiensis Marks and Culex spp. breeding in burrows of the land crab Cardisoma carnifex (Herbst) The technique was based on the crab\u2019s behavior, which involves the crab carrying food into its burrow. It was shown that appetizing baits impregnated with an insecticide were carried by crabs into the flooded chamber of their burrows. A field treatment of burrows was carried
out by sowing insecticide impregnated baits on the ground. The treatment coverage was almost perfect and the easy implementation of the technique enabled large areas to be treated in a short time. The bait was developed by compacting various flours, which easily incorporate a large variety of insecticide formulations. Although the baits can be easily stocked, a reliable insecticide is still to be found. The results indicate that our technique could be a method of choice for treating crab burrows.`,Year:"2002",Authors:"Lardeux, F., S\xE9chan, Y., Faauria, M.",Journal:"Journal of Medical Entomology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"39(4)",Pages:"658-661","Work Location":["French Polynesia"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3320",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Biological control of Culicidae with the copepod\xA0Mesocyclops aspericornis\xA0and larvivorous fish (Poeciliidae) in a village of French Polynesia",Description:"The copepod\xA0Mesocyclops aspericornis\xA0Daday and the larvivorous fishes\xA0Gambusia affinis\xA0(B. & G.) and\xA0Poecilia reticulata\xA0R. & B., were released into mosquito breeding sites in Tuherahera village, Tikehau atoll, French Polynesia, to control larvae of\xA0Aedes aegypti\xA0(L.),\xA0Ae.polynesiensis\xA0Marks,\xA0Culex annulirostris\xA0Skuse and\xA0Cx quinquefasciatus\xA0Say.

As part of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, mass drug administration is distributed to communities until surveillance indicates infection rates are below target prevalence thresholds. In some countries, including American Samoa, lymphatic filariasis transmission persists despite years of mass drug administration and/or has resurged after cessation. Nothing is known about the population genetics of\xA0Wuchereria bancrofti\xA0worms in Polynesia, or whether local transmission is persisting and/or increasing due to inadequate mass drug administration coverage, expansion from residual hotspots, reintroduction from elsewhere, or a combination. We extracted DNA from microfilariae on blood slides collected during prevalence surveys in 2014 and 2016, comprising 31 pools of five microfilariae from 22 persons living in eight villages. We sequenced 1104\xA0bp across three mitochondrial markers (ND4, COI, CYTB). We quantified parasite genetic differentiation using variant calls and estimated haplotypes using principal components analysis, F-statistics, and haplotype networks. Of the variants called, all but eight were shared across the main island of Tutuila, and three of those were from a previously described hotspot village, Fagali\u2019i. Genotypic data did not support population genetic structure among regions or villages in 2016, although differences were observed between worms collected in Fagali\u2019i in 2014 and those from 2016. Because estimated haplotype frequency varied between villages, these statistics suggested genetic differentiation, but were not consistent among villages. Finally, haplotype networks demonstrated American Samoan sequence clusters were related to previously published sequences from Papua New Guinea. These are, to our knowledge, the first reports of\xA0W. bancrofti\xA0genetic variation in Polynesia.

Lymphatic filariasis (LF) infection is generally diagnosed through parasitological identification of microfilariae (mf) in the blood. Although historically the most commonly used technique for counting mf is the thick blood smear based on 20\xA0\xB5l blood (TBS20), various other techniques and blood volumes have been applied. It is therefore a challenge to compare mf prevalence estimates from different LF-survey data. Our objective was to standardise microfilaraemia (mf) prevalence estimates to TBS20 as the reference diagnostic technique. Methods. We first performed a systematic review to identify studies reporting on comparative mf prevalence data as measured by more than one diagnostic test, including TBS20, on the same study population. Associations between mf prevalences based on different diagnostic techniques were quantified in terms of odds ratios (OR, with TBS20 blood as reference), using a meta-regression model. Results. We identified 606 articles matching our search strategy and included 14 in our analyses. The OR of the mf prevalences as measured by the more sensitive counting chamber technique (\u2265\u200950 \xB5l blood) was 2.90 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60\u20135.28). For membrane filtration (1 ml blood) the OR was 2.39 (95% CI: 1.62\u20133.53), Knott\u2019s technique it was 1.54 (95% CI: 0.72\u20133.29), and for TBS in \u2265 40 \xB5l blood it was 1.37 (95% CI: 0.81\u20132.30). Conclusions. We provided transformation factors to standardise mf prevalence estimates as detected by different diagnostic techniques to mf prevalence estimates as measured by TBS20.

In Neglected Diseases of Oceania (Loukas, A, ed)",Description:`Lymphatic filariasis caused by the mosquito-transmitted helminth parasite Wuchereria bancrofti is an important problem in Oceania. Of the 33 countries and territories included in this review, 24 have been found to be endemic for this disease at some time in the past, and 18 of these were classified as endemic at the start of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis in 2000. After the implementation of large mass drug administration campaigns and (to a lesser extent) vector control over the last 15 years, only ten Oceania countries and territories were still considered to have ongoing transmission of lymphatic filariasis in 2015. Through a systematic literature search and review, we identified 79 individual studies of filariasis in Oceania that were published in 70 papers between 1995 and 2015. Data on mosquito (by species) and human infection prevalence using all currently available diagnostic tests, as well as estimates of acute and chronic filariasis morbidity, were extracted from these publications and tabulated in chronological order by country and outcome measure, noting sampling method and sample size in order to evaluate study quality and precision. No studies were identified from Micronesia; most studies in Melanesia and Polynesia were found from Papua New Guinea (PNG) (30) and French Polynesia (16), respectively. All other countries in Melanesia and Polynesia were represented by 1\u20137 studies except Wallis and Futuna. The systematic review identified 19 published studies of mosquito infections and 62 of human infections but only 3 on acute morbidity (all from PNG in the 1990s) and 11 on chronic morbidity. Since Oceania has a diverse set of mosquito vectors, published reviews of relative efficiencies of different mosquito genera were examined to shed light on their transmission dynamics and hence the potential for elimination of filariasis in Oceania. The review indicates the need for collation of unpublished reports and studies in addition to more geographically representative studies of remaining filariasis infection distribution, as well as quantification of the disability (acute attacks, lymphoedema, elephantiasis and hydrocoele) that will remain once transmission is interrupted,
in order to plan for services to alleviate these lifelong effects.`,Year:"2016",Authors:"Graves, P.M., Wood, P., Bossin, H.C.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"Springer International Publishing","Volume/Issue":"Chapter 4",Pages:"101-142","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3345_Graves_et_al_2016_LF_in_Oceania_337815_Chapter_4.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3346",Category:"Correspondence and Emails",Title:"Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2007",Authors:"Huppatz, C., Durrheim, D.N.",Journal:"New England Journal of Medicine",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"357(23)",Pages:"2407","Work Location":["Multicountry Pacific"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3347",Category:"Presentations",Title:"MDA - Lymphatic Filariasis",Description:"Lymphatic filariasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases.

Previously, the spectrum of disease associated with lymphatic filariasis was largely attributed to the nature of the host immune response. Now, we appreciate that the duration and intensity of infection and possibly the direct influence of parasite-derived molecules also determine the risk of disease. Individuals chronically infected with lymphatic filariasis generally have an impaired lymphocyte proliferation response to filarial antigens and favour Th2-type cytokine responses. This ability to down-modulate the host immune response may help protect the host from disease. Defects in antigen-presenting cell (APC) function appear to participate in this acquired immune hyporesponsiveness, although the mechanisms as to how this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that repeated exposure to infective stage larvae and their secreted products may stimulate basophils and mast cells to related products that may impair APC function.",Year:"2001",Authors:"King, C.L.",Journal:"Parasite Immunology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"23",Pages:"363-371","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3024.2001.00395.x",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"3371",Category:"Theses",Title:"Comparative accuracy and 'field friendly' effectiveness of diagnostic tools for lymphatic filariasis and neurocyticercosis in Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste with consideration on the impact of parasitic reduction programs",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2010",Authors:"Reeve, D.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"James Cook University","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"309","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/19042",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"3372",Category:"Theses",Title:"Investigation of risk factors for better control and surveillance of lymphatic filariasis in Papua New Guinea",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2017",Authors:"Susapu, M.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"University of Liverpool","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"166","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3373",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"World Alliance Project: Implementation of community based health care targeting malaria, filariasis and intestinal parasites in the Nomad District, Western Province, Papua New Guinea",Description:"The Mid Strickland river report",Year:"2000",Authors:"Usurup, P.J.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"Porgera Joint Venture","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"24","Work Location":["Papua New Guinea"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3374",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"Papua New Guinea Lymphatic filariasis Elimination Program",Description:"Mission Report 25 March to 5 April 2007.  8 page report and 7 annexes about LF progam esp Milne Bay and Bougainville,  MDA in conjunction with bednet distribution.

Data obtained by the WHO Filariasis Research Unit in Rangoon were analysed, and the efficiency of the parasite from Stage III larva in the mosquito to the production of microfilariae was estimated as 6.04-6.71 x 10-5, indicating that an average of around 15 500 bites by " infective " mosquitos is necessary to produce I case ofmicrofilaraemia. This surprising result prompted a step-by-step analysis of the success of the parasite through departure from the mosquito, penetration of host tissues, survival to maturity, and encountering a mate in the human host. It was hoped that the second approach would identify some discrepancy in the original analysis, but when all sources of loss were combined, it was estimated that the expected efficiency was 4.78 x 0-5. The two estimates are within observational error of each other. The degree to which the two approaches agree leads to the conclusion that survival of the parasite is reasonably well known at all stages, and the calculations indicate that a high proportion of the population of Rangoon must be carrying parasites that are either dead or immature.

\u2022 To estimate national coverage (i.e. the proportion of the eligible population who swallowed the tablets) of the October 2012 MDA; 
\u2022 To determine which medical areas in Suva or sub-divisions in the rest of the Fiji territory targeted by the campaign have achieved at least 80% MDA coverage;

Recent World Health Organization guidelines have recommended two rounds of triple-drug therapy with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine (DEC), and albendazole (IDA), in areas where mass drug administration (MDA) results with two drugs (DEC and albendazole) have been suboptimal, as is the case in Samoa. In August 2018, Samoa was the first country in the world to implement countrywide triple-drug MDA. This paper aims to describe Samoa\u2019s experience with program coverage and adverse events (AEs) in the first round of triple-drug MDA. We conducted a large cross-sectional community survey to assess MDA awareness, reach, compliance, coverage and AEs in September/October 2018, 7\u201311 weeks after the first round of triple-drug MDA. In our sample of 4420 people aged \uFFFD2 years (2.2% of the population), age-adjusted estimates indicated that 89.0% of the eligible population were offered MDA, 83.9% of the eligible population took MDA (program coverage), and 80.2% of the total population took MDA (epidemiological coverage). Overall, 83.8% (2986/3563) reported that they did not feel unwell at all after taking MDA.

Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) were conducted in 2013 (failed in NWU) and 2017 (all three EUs failed). In 2018, Samoa was the first in the world to distribute nationwide triple-drug MDA using ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole. Surveillance and Monitoring to Eliminate LF and Scabies from Samoa (SaMELFS Samoa) is an operational research program designed to evaluate the effectiveness of triple-drug MDA on LF transmission and scabies prevalence in Samoa, and to compare the usefulness of different indicators of LF transmission. This paper reports results from the 2018 baseline survey and aims to i) investigate antigen (Ag) prevalence and spatial epidemiology, including geographic clustering; ii) compare Ag prevalence between two different age groups (5\u20139 years versus \uFFFD10 years) as indicators of areas of ongoing transmission; and iii) assess the prevalence of limb lymphedema in those aged \uFFFD15 years. Methods A community-based cluster survey was conducted in 30 randomly selected and five purposively selected clusters (primary sampling units, PSUs), each comprising one or two villages.

Data Availability Statement: All relevant data are within the paper. We are unable to provide individual-level antigen prevalence data and and purposive PSUs, and by region. Intraclass correlation (ICC) was used to quantify clustering at regions, PSUs, and households. Results A total of 3940 persons were included (1942 children aged 5\u20139 years, 1998 persons aged \uFFFD10 years). Adjusted Ag prevalence in all ages \uFFFD5 years in randomly and purposively selected PSUs were 4.0% (95% CI 2.8\u20135.6%) and 10.0% (95% CI 7.4\u201313.4%), respectively. In random PSUs, Ag prevalence was lower in those aged 5\u20139 years (1.3%, 95% CI 0.8\u2013 2.1%) than \uFFFD10 years (4.7%, 95% CI 3.1\u20137.0%), and poorly correlated at the PSU level (R-square = 0.1459). Adjusted Ag prevalence in PSUs ranged from 0% to 10.3% (95% CI 5.9\u201317.6%) in randomly selected and 3.8% (95% CI 1.3\u201310.8%) to 20.0% (95% CI 15.3\u2013 25.8%) in purposively selected PSUs. ICC for Ag-positive individuals was higher at households (0.46) compared to PSUs (0.18) and regions (0.01). Conclusions Our study confirmed ongoing transmission of LF in Samoa, in accordance with the 2017 TAS results. Ag prevalence varied significantly between PSUs, and there was poor correlation between prevalence in 5\u20139 year-olds and older ages, who had threefold higher prevalence.

One key challenge is locating residual infections that can perpetuate the transmission cycle. We show how a targeted sampling strategy using predictions from a geospatial model, combining random forests and geostatistics, can improve the sampling efciency for identifying locations with high infection prevalence. Predictions were made based on the household locations of infected persons identifed from previous surveys, and environmental variables relevant to mosquito density. Results show that targeting sampling using model predictions would have allowed 52% of infections to be identifed by sampling just 17.7% of households. The odds ratio for identifying an infected individual in a household at a predicted high risk compared to a predicted low risk location was 10.2 (95% CI 4.2\u2013 22.8). This study provides evidence that a \u2018one size fts all\u2019 approach is unlikely to yield optimal results when making programmatic decisions based on model predictions.

Through transmission by the mosquito vector Aedes, Fiji has suffered the burden of remaining endemic with LF despite efforts at elimination prior to 1999. In the year 1999, Fiji agreed to take part in the Pacific Programme for Elimination of LF (PacELF) and the Global Programme to Eliminate LF. Methods: This study reviewed and collated past data on LF in Fiji between 1997 and 2007. Sources included published papers as well as unpublished PacELF and WHO program meeting and survey reports. Records were held at Fiji\u2019s Department of Health and Medical Services, James Cook University and the WHO office in Suva, Fiji. Results: Baseline surveys between 1997 and 2002 showed that Fiji was highly endemic for LF with an estimated 16.6% of the population antigen positive and 6.3% microfilaria positive at that time. Five rounds of annual mass drug administration (MDA) using albendazole and diethylcarbamazine commenced in 2002. Programmatic coverage reported was 58\u201370% per year, but an independent coverage survey in 2006 in Northern Division after the fifth MDA suggested that actual coverage may have been higher. Monitoring of the program consisted of antigen prevalence surveys in all ages with sentinel and spot check surveys carried out in 2002 (pre MDA), 2004, and 2005, together with knowledge, attitude, and practice surveys. The stop-MDA survey (C survey) in 2007 was a nationwide stratified cluster survey of all ages according to PacELF guidelines, designed to sample by administrative division to identify areas still needing MDA. The national antigen prevalence in 2007 was reduced by more than a third to 9.5%, ranging from 0.9% in Western Division to 15.4% in Eastern Division, while microfilaria prevalence was reduced by almost four-fifths to 1.4%. Having not reached the target threshold of 1% prevalence in all ages, Fiji wisely decided to continue MDA after 2007 but to move from nationwide implementation to four (later five) separate evaluation units with independent timelines using global guidelines, building on program experience to put more emphasis on increasing coverage through prioritized communication strategies, community participation, and morbidity alleviation. Conclusion: Fiji conducted nationwide MDA for LF annually between 2002 and 2006, monitored by extensive surveys of prevalence, knowledge, and coverage. From a high baseline prevalence in all divisions, large reductions in overall and age-specific prevalence were achieved, especially in the prevalence of microfilariae, but the threshold for stopping MDA was not reached. Fiji has a large rural and geographically widespread population, program management was not consistent over this period, and coverage achieved was likely not optimal in all areas. After learning from these many challenges and activities, Fiji was able to build on the progress achieved and the heterogeneity observed in prevalence to realign towards a more stratified and improved program after 2007.

Elimination of transmission is the onchocerciasis target and global elimination as a public health problem is the end point for lymphatic filariasis. Where program duration, treatment coverage, and compliance are sufficiently high, elimination is achievable for both parasites within defined geographic areas. However, transmission has re-emerged after apparent elimination in some areas, and in others has continued despite years of mass drug treatment. A critical question is whether this re-emergence and/or persistence of transmission is due to persistence of local parasites\u2014i.e., the result of insufficient duration or drug coverage, poor parasite response to the drugs, or inadequate methods of assessment and/or criteria for determining when to stop treatment\u2014or due to re-introduction of parasites\xA0via\xA0human or vector movement from another endemic area.

Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) is endemic in Fiji but its prevalence is not known and likely to have changed after a decade of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis (LF). By linking with LF transmission assessment surveys (LF-TAS), we undertook the first nation-wide assessment of STH in Fijian primary schools, as well as an analysis of factors associated with STH infections. Methodology/Principal findings. A cross-sectional assessment for STH was conducted in all four Divisions of Fiji from 2014 to 2015. In the Western, Central, and Northern Divisions, schools were sub-sampled after LF-TAS, while, in the Eastern Division, schools were selected via simple random sampling. For the diagnosis of STH, stool samples were examined by coproscopy with a single Kato-Katz thick smear (KK) and the formol-ether-acetate concentration technique, except for the samples from the Eastern Division where only KK was used. Mean prevalence of any STH among class 1\u20132 students at the national level was 10.5% (95% CI: 6.9\u201315.5). Across the three Divisions via LF-TAS, the prevalence levels for ascariasis were 8.7% (95% CI: 4.3\u201316.6), hookworm 3.9% (95% CI: 2.3\u20136.6) and trichuriasis 0%. In the Eastern Division, ascariasis prevalence was 13.3% (95% CI: 6.4\u201325.6), and hookworm 0.7% (95% CI: 0.2\u20132.5), with one case of trichuriasis. Among class 3\u20138 students, ascariasis prevalence was lower. Lower risk of any STH was associated with wearing shoes (adjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32\u20130.90) and having piped water from the Fiji Water Authority at home (adjusted OR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25\u20130.92). Conclusions. After a decade of community-based LF-MDA, STH in school-age children in Fiji is now close to 10%, but localities of endemicity remain.

The presence of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in American Samoa has long been recognized, but gained more attention after the infection was detected in U.S. service men during World War II. Residents of American Samoa received two rounds mass drug treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in the 1960s that led to great reductions in the prevalence of microfilaremia. Reid and Kimura showed that microfilaria levels remained low for many years after the interventions.  Shortly after the World Health Assembly called for the global elimination of LF in 1997, the Pacific Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PacELF) was organized. One of the first objectives of PacELF was to conduct antigen surveys using a rapid immunochromatographic test (ICT) to characterize the status of the member countries with respect to LF.  Based on ICT surveys conducted in 1999, PacELF estimated that 16.5% of residents in American Samoa were infected with Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasite that causes LF.  The American Samoa Department of Health (DOH) began a territory-wide MDA program in 2000 with the goal of eliminating LF as a public health problem. MDA programs are based on the use of DEC and albendazole and target all persons in endemic districts except for children less than 2 years of age, pregnant women and severely ill persons.  In the initial years of the program, nurses, accompanied by health assistants, were responsible for supervising patient registration and drug administration.  Teams of nurses circulated through villages going door-to-door to deliver the drugs.  Return visits were scheduled to capture family members who were missed.

The population of Taveuni is 12,130 1 and with its well known high rainfall area, this volcanic tropical island is covered with a lush tropical rainforest making it the "Garden Island of Fiji" and the home to the only extinct flower called the Tagimoucia. The people lived mainly around the coastal areas and their livelihoods are coconuts (areas are lined with acres of coconut plantations), dalo and yaqona farming. The lush tropical climate of Taveuni had enabled the area to grow all types of root crops, bananas, fruit trees and other wild plants needed to sustain the healthy population but history showed that Taveuni failed to maintain and control the thriving of mosquitoes as a vector contributing to the higher number of prevalence rate for lymphatic filariasis amongst the general population due mainly to the favourable climatic condition of the island.
There are three medical areas namely Waiyevo, Qamea and Vuna and two nursing stations namely Bouma and Yacata. Taveuni Subdivision is managed by a Subdivisional Medical Officer under the administrative management of the Northern Health Services of the Ministry of Health in Labasa which is located in the mainland of Vanua Levu. Taveuni has been identified as an endemic area for Lymphatic Filariasis since 1960's and a study undertaken then (mf test) revealed that Labasa, which is in the northern part of Vanua Levu, had a prevalence rate of 6.4% and Taveuni Island which is located in the Southern part of Vanua Levu, had a prevalence rate of 25.2% 2. Attempts to control lymphatic filariasis by the Ministry of Health in Fiji for Taveuni and the other endemic areas in Fiji throughout the years proved to have slowly brought down the prevalence rate. A C Survey conducted in 2007 through ICT antigen test revealed a 2.9% prevalence rate for the main island of Vanua Levu and a sentinel survey done separately for Taveuni during the same year revealed a prevalence rate of 6.8% 3. The figures above revealed an improvement in the infection rate but do not achieve the recommended criteria by the WHO Lymphatic Filariasis Managers Guideline of less than 1% prevalence rate which will show that the transmission has been interrupted. With the second phase (2008 \u2013 2012) of ongoing mass drug distribution, it was assumed that the main island of Vanua Levu could have reached less than 1% prevalence rate and Taveuni, with a prevalence rate of 6.8% was doubtful to have reached less than 1% prevalence rate at the same time. This was the background of the spot \u2013 check survey for Taveuni to confirm those doubts. The main island of Vanua Levu then proceeded to the transmission assessment survey.`,Year:"2013",Authors:"National Filariasis Unit",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"21","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3445",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"PacELF Country MDA data",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2003",Authors:"World Health Organization",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"4","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3446",Category:"Forms",Title:"Re-application for albendazole from the National Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis by American Samoa",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2002",Authors:"Sunia, F.S.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"17","Work Location":["American Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3447",Category:"Action/Strategic Plans",Title:"Recommendations from the LF expert team to the American Samoa LF program",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2008",Authors:"Henderson, RH., Ottesen, E., Lammie, P., Ehrenberg, J., Capuano, C., Ramaiah, KD., Palmer, K.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"2","Work Location":["American Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3448",Category:"Action/Strategic Plans",Title:"Recommendations from the LF expert team to the Samoa LF program",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2008",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"1","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3449",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Samoa Data 30 Oct 2004",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2004",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"1","Work Location":["Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3450",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Summary of Marshall Islands Survey",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2011",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"2","Work Location":["Republic of the Marshall Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3451",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"TAS strengthening in American Samoa",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2017",Authors:"Lau, C., Graves, P., Sheridan, S., Sheel, M.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"31","Work Location":["American Samoa"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3452",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"The Programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in French Polynesia Year 2001 2nd round of the mass drug administration",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2001",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"4","Work Location":["French Polynesia"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3453",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Annual report Tuvalu Midterm Evaluation of MDA impact (B survey) 2004",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2005",Authors:"Latasi, F.F.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"9","Work Location":["Tuvalu"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3454",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"MDA 2004 Report for Tuvalu",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2005",Authors:"Latasi, F.F.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"2","Work Location":["Tuvalu"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3455",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Neglected tropical diseases in Cook Islands -

The Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) parasite in Kiribati is Wuchereria bancrofti nocturnally periodic. The main vector is Culex quinquefasciatus, which has a nighttime activity pattern. After a briefing with the WHO Country Liaison Officer the writer met with the Principal Nursing Officer of the Northern District who is also the national coordinator of the LF elimination program. The writer met with the pharmacist assistant, the acting director of laboratory services, the director of the statistics office, the doctors of the main hospital and the staff of two health centers. Two visits to patients with elephantiasis were organised by the national coordinator and the writer used these opportunities to do on-the-spot training on individual care and treatment (demonstration on how to wash sick legs and to provide proper advices).
Kiribati completed 5 rounds of MDA with a reported coverage below 65% except for the last round of MDA. The main challenges currently facing the program are the lack of detailed data on the work completed so far and on the sentinel sites surveyed. It is therefore difficult to get a clear understanding of the current LF situation.
The post MDA survey will be of tremendous importance as it will help to answer many of the pending questions. This survey should be considered as a priority by the program.
The morbidity control program has been discussed and a basic plan has been developed with an estimated budget. Potential partners like the Pacific Leprosy Foundation (PLF) should be approached to provide financial support for this part of the LF program.
The vector control activities could also be further developed. LLN will be sent to Kiribati to cover the islands identified for distribution.`,Year:"2007",Authors:"Capuano, C.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"21","Work Location":["Kiribati"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3464",Category:"Action/Strategic Plans",Title:"Filariasis Elimination, Control of Soil Transmitted Helminths and Health Promoting Schools in the Pacific, Apia, Samoa, 23rd \u2013 27th Aug 2004",Description:"This document belongs with PacELF_3465",Year:"2004",Authors:"Okesene, T.K.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"3","Work Location":["Niue"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3465",Category:"Mission Reports",Title:"Evaluation of Filariasis Mass Drug Administration (MDA) and Blood Survey 2004",Description:"This document belongs with PacELF_3464",Year:"2004",Authors:"NO VALUE",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"4","Work Location":["Niue"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3466",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"Changes in the feeding behaviour of a malaria vector, Anopheles farauti Lav., following use of DDT as a residual spray in houses in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate",Description:"1. To investigate the failure of DDT to interrupt malaria transmission in parts of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, regular all-night man-biting catches of malaria vectors were made before and after DDT house spraying on San Cristobal Island. 2 Changes were observed in the man-biting behaviour of Anopheles farauti. There was a reduction in the degree of entry into houses and a shifting of the times of peak biting. Whereas before spraying the indoor and outdoor biting cycles differed, after spraying there was no difference although both the indoor and outdoor cycles had altered. 3 DDT was found to have a deterrent effect on An.farauti but this effect decreased with time. 4 DDT also appears to eliminate a dominant indoor feeding fraction of the farauti population. Following this there can be an increase in an outdoor feeding fraction which can be responsible for a resumption of malaria transmission. 5 Biting cycles obtained before spraying are also shown for An.koliensis and An.punctulatus.",Year:"1975",Authors:"Taylor, B.",Journal:"Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"127 (3)",Pages:"277-292","Work Location":["Solomon Islands"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3466_Taylor_1972_PROC_ROY_ENT_SOC_LOND_Changes_in_the_feeding_behaviour_Anopheles_farauti_DDT_Solomon_Islands.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3467",Category:"Theses",Title:"Anopheline-borne filariasis and its control with particular reference to the Solomon Islands",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1975",Authors:"Webber, R.H.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"Ministry of Health Solomon Islands","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"112","Work Location":["Solomon Islands"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3468",Category:"Theses",Title:"Permethrin impregnated bednets and DDT residual sprayin. Multicentre comparative trial in Solomon Islands",Description:"A malaria intervention comparative trial was carried out in Solomon Islands between 1987 and 1992, involving 7 pairs 14 communities, with 29,182 people. Seven communities were given bed nets impregnated with permethrin annually at 0.5g/m', and the others sprayed biannually with DDT at dosage 2g/m3. Each pair was evaluated for about two years, by measuring entomological indices, prevalence of infection, incidence of infection, and levels of community compliance. An intensive differential cost analysis of both interventions was done in one pair of the communities and an analysis on cost and benefit of PCD mechanism was done in three pairs. Anopheles farauti, the main vector, (A. punctulatus, an inland vector became very rare with interventions), maintained the early evening biting peak and high outdoor biting. The highest transmission potential was indoor with high parity (54.1%) and sporozoite rate (1.42%). It avoided contact on DDT sprayed surface and was not killed even though it was still sensitive with a 75.1% mortality. There were neither changes in biting density, nor parous rates with DDT spraying. Permethrin impregnated bed nets reduced biting density by an estimated 53.69%. The parous rate indoor was reduced by 11.64% when compared with that in the comparison area, and those caught in the bed nets area did not have any sporozoites. Prevalence of infection, by quarterly prevalence surveys revealed a 21.2% difference between the intervention areas after two years. The most significant decline was in the under 10 year old group (p<0.01) in permethrin treated bed nets, including in infants (p<0.05). The decline was especially marked with Plasmodium falciparum. There were increases in the DDT area, including P. falciparum in the younger age groups. DDT spraying did not have any effect on the incidence of infection. Permethrin impregnated bed nets reduced malaria incidence, by an estimated 49%. This reduction was particularly significant however on children under ten years old (p<0.0001) and marked with P. falciparum. Compliance with DDT declined by 30% but with bednets it remained high above 85%. These results confirmed that permethrin impregnated bednets are more effective than DDT residual spraying in controlling malaria in Solomon Islands. The operational costs for DDT spraying was $8.53 and impregnated bed nets $3.85 per capita per year. The mean cost of processing and examining a PCD slide is $0.40. These cost indices took account of all materials, personnel and administration involved. It took a mean of 6.1 days from the time the smear was taken to the time examined (SE = 0.21,95%CI 5.71 to 6.53 days). It would take twice this time for a result to be received by the health workers managing patients. Only 20% of blood slides could contribute to patient management. Based on these findings, all that is necessary is to make blood smears of patients less than 10 years of age for epidemiological evaluation of vector control interventions in malaria programme. This will save scarce resources at primary health care level. Making blood slides of everyone would not further add significant information and benefit, at an extra cost. The only exceptions are, those critically ill with malaria, complicated malaria and a patient suspected to have drug resistant malaria. Permethrin impregnated bednets are a cost effective way to control malaria in primary health care and the most cost benefit way to evaluate vector control intervention is careful monitoring of PCD results, especially with P. falciparum malaria of children under 10 years old.",Year:"1992",Authors:"Kere, N.K.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"281","Work Location":["Solomon Islands"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3468_Kere_thesis_Permethrin_impregnated_bednets_and_DDT_r.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3469",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Integrated control and Aedes polynesiensis: an outline of the Tokelau Islands project, and its results",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"1966",Authors:"Laird, M.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"10","Work Location":["Tokelau"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3470",Category:"Presentations",Title:"Tonga LF elimination dossier review",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2016",Authors:"Ottesen, E., Graves, P., Lammie, P.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"16","Work Location":["Tonga"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3471",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Tonga Lymphatic Filariasis follow survey 2011",Description:"NO VALUE",Year:"2011",Authors:"Kingdom of Tonga Ministry of Health",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"9","Work Location":["Tonga"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3472",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Summary review report for the Kingdom of Tonga",Description:"Signed dossier executive summary report by the Lymphatic Filariasis Regional Dossier Review Group (RDRG) in the Western Pacific Region",Year:"2017",Authors:"Kingdom of Tonga Ministry of Health",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"3","Work Location":["Tonga"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3473",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"The mosquitoes of the Banks and Torres Island groups of the south pacific",Description:"In August 1971 a total of 1003 specimens of Culicidae were collected from 2 little known island groups ofthe New Hebrides, the Banks and the Torres, 637 (39 female, 12 male, 148 P, 13 p, 419 L, 6 1) and 366 (46 female, 3 male, 73 P, 13 p, 231 L), respectively.

The survey targeted 881 students from the 12 primary schools in Wallis and Futuna (WAF). Children from the last four levels (CE1 to CM2) were tested for the circulation of filarial antigen (CFA) with an antigen test Filariasis Test Strip (FTS). We examined whether the prevalence of filarial antigenaemia was less than 1% of children tested.
Of the 881 eligible students, 779 children (88%) have been tested, 54 consents have not been returned and 48 students were absent. Of the children tested, 401 were boys (52%) and 372 Girls (48%). Their ages ranged from 6 to 13 years (mean and median 9).
The result was negative for 772 children and invalid for six. One child was found positive for LF antigen. This represents a value well below the 1% threshold. The positive cases corresponded to a weak positive test in a girl of 11, living in Wallis since birth. Overall, the prevalence of LF in this population was 0, 13% to WAF, 0, 19% to Wallis and 0% to Futuna.

We sought reliable evidence of the effects of albendazole on the disease and the parasite.

Objectives: To summarize the effects of albendazole alone or in combination with antifilarial drugs for clinical treatment and community control of lymphatic filariasis.

Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (August 2005), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2005), EMBASE (1974 to August 2005), LILACS (1982 to August 2005), and reference lists. We also contacted researchers, the World Health Organization, and GlaxoSmithKline.

Selection criteria: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of albendazole alone or combined with another antifilarial drug for treating individuals with lymphatic filariasis, or for reducing transmission in endemic communities.

Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data. Authors contacted investigators for missing information or clarification.

Main results: Seven trials including 6997 participants (995 with detectable microfilariae) met the criteria. A comparison of albendazole and placebo detected no effect on microfilariae prevalence (920 participants; 3 trials); one trial (499 participants) reported significantly lower microfilariae density at six months. Albendazole performed slightly worse than ivermectin in two trials (436 participants). Compared with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), two small trials (56 participants) found little difference in microfilariae prevalence over an extended follow up. One larger trial (502 participants) found a statistically significant effect for DEC at six months, but none at three months. Microfilariae prevalence and density were statistically significantly lower with the combination of albendazole and ivermectin compared with ivermectin alone in two of three trials (649 participants). Two trials compared albendazole plus DEC with DEC alone and found no statistically significant difference in microfilariae prevalence, though one trial favoured the combination at six months (relative risk 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 1.21; 491 participants). This trial also found a statistically significant reduction in microfilariae density.

Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute that albendazole co-administered with DEC or ivermectin is more effective than DEC or ivermectin alone in clearing microfilariae or killing adult worms. Albendazole combined with ivermectin appears to have a small effect on microfilaraemia, but this was not consistently demonstrated. The effect of albendazole against adult and larval filarial parasites, alone and in combination with other antifilarial drugs, deserves further rigorous research.`,Year:"2005",Authors:"Critchley, J., Addiss, D., Gamble, C., Garner, P., Gelband, H., Ejere, H.",Journal:"The Cochrane Library",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"14","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3477_Int_Fil_Review_Group_(Addiss_Crtichley_Ejere_Garner_Gelband_Gamble)-2004.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3478",Category:"Presentations",Title:"Fiji's LF program",Description:"Plans for survey",Year:"2007",Authors:"Ozaki, M.",Journal:"NO VALUE",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"NO VALUE",Pages:"11","Work Location":["Fiji"],"Access Rights":"Contact PacELF at JCU",Language:["English"],URL:"",Icon:"schedule"},{ID:"3479",Category:"Forms",Title:"Questionnaire for the survey on Equipment Supply Program for Filariasis",Description:`In order to better fight rampant Lymphatic Filariasis in the Pacific, the Government of Japan has executed Medical Equipment Supply Program for Filariasis to the Government of the Republic of the Fiji Islands (hereinafter referred to as \u201CFiji\u201D) over the past years, and is also ready to supply equipment for 2008.

Studies from 1967 to the present conducted in Brazil, Japan, Tanzania, India, China, and Taiwan involving administration of DEC salt for 18 days to 1 year, have shown this intervention to be effective for both bancroftian and brugian filariasis, as measured by reductions in both microfilarial density and positivity, and in some studies through reduction in mosquito positivity rates as well. Furthermore, studies suggest specific advantages from using DEC salt, including lack of side effects, particularly for bancroftian filariasis, and ability to reduce prevalence below 1 % when used in conjunction with standard regimens of DEC tablets. However, use of DEC salt as a control tool suffers from a concern that health authorities might find it difficult to manage a programme involving a commodity such as salt. In the past decade, the very successful global efforts to eliminate iodine deficiency through universal salt iodization have demonstrated that partnership with the salt industry can be both successful and effective as a public health tool. Use of DEC salt can be most successfully implemented in areas in which (a) there is adequate governmental support for its use and for elimination of filariasis, (b) filariasis-endemic areas are clearly defined, (c) political leaders, health officials and the salt industry agree that DEC salt is an appropriate intervention, (d) the salt industry is well-organized and has known distribution patterns, (e) a successful national salt iodization effort exists, (f) a monitoring system exists that ensures adequacy of salt iodine content during production and that can also measure household coverage, and (g) measurement of impact on transmission of LF with the new antigen or filarial DNA detection methods can be established. There are advantages and disadvantages of using DEC-fortified salt compared with other interventions for LF elimination programmes, but rather than being considered as a 'competing' intervention, DEC salt should be seen as an additional option. Indeed, it is likely that many countries will derive maximal benefit from the synergistic effects of combining different intervention strategies in their national programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.",Year:"2000",Authors:"Houston, R.",Journal:"Parasitology",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"121 (SUPPL.)",Pages:"S161-S173","Work Location":["Multicountry Global"],"Access Rights":"Open via Publisher",Language:["English"],URL:"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0031182000007150",Icon:"open_in_new"},{ID:"3512",Category:"Reports and Results",Title:"Research on Rapid Geographical Assessment of Bancroftian Filariasis",Description:"prepared during a protocol development workshop held from 22-25 July 1997 in James cook University, Townsville, Australia.

Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is targeted for global elimination through treatment of entire at-risk populations with repeated annual mass drug administration (MDA). Essential for program success is defining and confirming the appropriate endpoint for MDA when transmission is presumed to have reached a level low enough that it cannot be sustained even in the absence of drug intervention. Guidelines advanced by WHO call for a transmission assessment survey (TAS) to determine if MDA can be stopped within an LF evaluation unit (EU) after at least five effective rounds of annual treatment. To test the value and practicality of these guidelines, a multicenter operational research trial was undertaken in 11 countries covering various geographic and epidemiological settings. Methodology. The TAS was conducted twice in each EU with TAS-1 and TAS-2 approximately 24 months apart. Lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) formed the basis of the TAS survey design but specific EU characteristics defined the survey site (school or community), eligible population (6\u20137 year olds or 1st\u20132nd\xA0graders), survey type (systematic or cluster-sampling), target sample size, and critical cutoff (a statistically powered threshold below which transmission is expected to be no longer sustainable). The primary diagnostic tools were the immunochromatographic (ICT) test for\xA0W. bancrofti\xA0EUs and the BmR1 test (Brugia Rapid or PanLF) for\xA0Brugia spp. EUs. Principal Findings/Conclusions. In 10 of 11 EUs, the number of TAS-1 positive cases was below the critical cutoff, indicating that MDA could be stopped. The same results were found in the follow-up TAS-2, therefore, confirming the previous decision outcome. Sample sizes were highly sex and age-representative and closely matched the target value after factoring in estimates of non-participation. The TAS was determined to be a practical and effective evaluation tool for stopping MDA although its validity for longer-term post-MDA surveillance requires further investigation.",Year:"2013",Authors:"Chu, B.K., Deming, M., Biritwum, N.K., Bougma, W.R., Dorkenoo, A.M., El-Setouhy, M., Fischer, P.U., Gass, K., Gonzalez de Pe\xF1a, M., Mercado-Hernandez, L., Kyelem, D., Lammie, P.J., Flueckiger, R.M., Mwingira U.J, Noordin, R., Owusu, I.O., Ottesen, E.A., Pavluck, A., Pilotte, N., Rao, R.U., Samarasekera, D., Schmaedick, M.A., Settinayake, S., Simonsen, P.E., Supali, T., Taleo, F., Torres, M., Weil, G.J., Won, K.Y.",Journal:"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases",Publisher:"NO VALUE","Volume/Issue":"7(12)",Pages:"e2584","Work Location":["American Samoa","Vanuatu"],"Access Rights":"Open",Language:["English"],URL:"/documents/PacELF_3520_Chu_et_al_2013_PLOS_NTDs_TAS_to_define_endpoints_multicenter_evaluation.pdf",Icon:"file_download"},{ID:"3521",Category:"Scientific Papers",Title:"A Research Agenda for Helminth Diseases of Humans: Diagnostics for Control and Elimination Programs",Description:"Diagnostic tools appropriate for undertaking interventions to control helminth infections are key to their success. Many diagnostic tests for helminth infection have unsatisfactory performance characteristics and are not well suited for use in the parasite control programmes that are being increasingly implemented. Although the application of modern laboratory research techniques to improve diagnostics for helminth infection has resulted in some technical advances, uptake has not been uniform. Frequently, pilot or proof of concept studies of promising diagnostic technologies have not been followed by much needed product development, and in many settings diagnosis continues to rely on insensitive and unsatisfactory parasitological or serodiagnostic techniques. In contrast, PCR-based xenomonitoring of arthropod vectors, and use of parasite recombinant proteins as reagents for serodiagnostic tests, have resulted in critical advances in the control of specific helminth parasites.
