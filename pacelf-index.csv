Drug coverage was well below prescribed targets in the first three campaigns, ranging from 24 to 52% of the total population. Evaluation findings from a variety of formative research methods identified opportunities to improve MDA coverage and ensuing program modifications resulted in increased drug coverage of 65-71% in the following four annual distributions.

Patients/Method: We developed three main types of scotomectomy-plasty: unilateral, bilateral and resection of the inferior pole, utilized in a series of 50 scrotomectomy-plasty in a homogeneous series of 148 hydrocelectomy in 117 patients. Results: 92% of patients treated by scrotomectomy-plasty had a hydrocele at an advanced stage (54% stage III and 38% stage IV). In 24% of preoperative indications for scrotomectomy-plasty we observed during surgery a sufficient retraction of the scrotum to prevent it. Thus, out of 1 17 patients 43% had a scrotomectomy-plasty. We recorded 6 complications, all in hydroceles stages III or IV with scrotomectomy-plasty. Five of these patients had a hematocele or chylocele. Two did not benefit from our compressive dressing. These complications only delayed by a few days the complete cure. In all cases the esthetic result was very satisfactory. Conclusion: The esthetic and functional result of hydrocelectomy is significantly completed through resectionplasty of the scrotum without increasing the postoperative morbidity in the immediate and close follow up. The three main types of scrotomectomy-plasty that we developed and utilized allowed us to properly manage all stages from I to IV of our clinical classification.The technique should be extended to other homogeneous series for a more precise codification of the procedures as outlined and a review of patients on distant follow up.",2013,"Capuano, G.P., Capuano, C.",Fiji Journal of Public Health,,2(2),,,Fiji,75,Contact PacELF at JCU,Hydrocelectomy,,English,,PacELF_75 Capuano and Capuano 2013 FIJI J PUB HLTH Reduction of the scrotum by scrotomectomy and plasty.pdf

Supported by a strong US sponsoring, a large scale control campaign based on diethylcarbamazine (DEC) distribution was launched and led to the method of spaced doses (the most useful protocol being one annual DEC dose). Progressively applied to the whole Polynesian population since 1974, this very innovative programme had generated the idea of a pos-sible eradication of the parasitosis. Meanwhile at laboratory level important progress in Immunology (mainly the validation of rapid diagnosis tests detecting a specific antigenemia) and later in Molecular Biology (with the main application being the follow-up of the infection status of the vector Aedes polynesiensis) questioned this optimistic concept (one lesson given by the study of Maupiti island, considered as a 0% reference island for a long time). More recently a regional WHO-sponsorized control programme, called PacELF, has for main objective the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in the South Pacific region near 2010. This objective argues for using a (DEC and albendazole) drug combination cumulating micro- and macro-filaricid activities.

108,Fiji,521,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Ambient temperature effects on the extrinsic incubation period of Wuchereria bancrofti in Aedes polynesiensis: implications for filariasis transmission dynamics and distribution in French Polynesia,"Temperature effects on development of the human filarial parasite Wuchereria bancrofti (Cobbold) (Filaridea: Onchocercidae) in the main Pacific vector Aedes polynesiensis Marks (Diptera: Culicidae) are analysed in relation to ambient climatic conditions. A statistical model of the extrinsic cycle duration as a function of temperature is described and used to distinguish three patterns of W. bancrofti transmission dynamics: continuous, fluctuating and discontinuous, occurring from north to south geographically among French Polynesian archipelagos. In the northerly Marquesas Islands (8-11 degrees S) filariasis transmission is continuous and very active, facilitated by perennially high temperatures combined with constantly high rates of man-vector contact. In the southerly Australes Islands (21-28 degrees S) filariasis transmission is seasonally discontinuous and, during the cooler months (May-September), the model predicts virtually no transmission because the cycle duration exceeds the life expectancy of the vector. In the Society Islands (16-18 degrees S), between the Marquesas and Australes, transmission is predicted to be intermediate as expected from their latitude, with seasonally fluctuating transmission potential. In the Tuamotu Islands (also geographically intermediate: 14-23 degrees S), with theoretically perennial transmission potential, transmission occurs only intermittently, being limited by other human and environmental factors whereby man-vector contact is confined to seasonal agricultural situations. Generally, among French Polynesian archipelagos where Aedes polynesiensis is the vector, the transmission potential for W. bancrofti and resulting disease manifestations of lymphatic filariasis in humans are correlated with ambient temperature due to the degree of southern latitude.",2001,"Lardeux, F., Cheffort, J.",Medical and Veterinary Entomology,,15(2),167-176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0269-283X.2001.00305.x,French Polynesia,108,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,English,,PacELF_108 Lardeux and Cheffort 2001 MED VET ENTOMOL Ambient temperature effects on the extrinsic incubation period of Wuchereria bancrofti in Aedes polynesiensis.pdf
109,Fiji,522,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Control of the Aedes vectors of the dengue viruses and Wuchereria bancrofti: the French Polynesian experience,"In most of the 130 islands of French Polynesia, the stenotopic mosquitoes Aedes aegypti (the main local vector for the viruses causing dengue) and Aedes polynesiensis (the main local vector of Wuchereria bancrofti) share many breeding sites in water containers such as discarded cans, coconut shells, buckets and water-storage pots and drums. In addition to selective application of insecticides, non-polluting methods of controlling these mosquitoes have been evaluated during the last decade in two main ecological situations: (1) villages, where Aedes breeding sites are typically peridomestic; and (2) flooded burrows of land crabs, the major source of Ae. polynesiensis throughout the South Pacific region. Large-scale trials of biological control agents, such as mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis and Poecilia reticulata) and copepods (Mesocyclops aspericornis), and of integrated-control strategies have demonstrated the efficacy of certain techniques and control agents against the target Aedes populations in some village situations. Generally, mechanical methods (the use of layers of polystyrene beads against mosquito larvae and pupae, and screening against adult mosquitoes) were more efficient than use of the biological control agents. By integrating several methods of control, mosquito densities (as measured by human-bait collections and larval surveys) were reduced significantly compared with the results of concurrent sampling from untreated villages, and control remained effective for months after the interventions ceased. In land-crab burrows, the first attempts to control Aedes larvae used bacterial agents (Bacillus thuringiensis) and predatory copepods gave disappointing results. Mesocyclops aspericornis could be an effective control agent if the burrows were constantly flooded, but most burrows dry out and refill periodically, so copepod populations do not survive. As it proved difficult to reach all corners of the long sinuous burrows with any control agent, larvicidal (chlorpyrifos-methyl) baits were developed for foraging crabs to carry into their burrows. This novel technique proved to be effective and could become the method of choice for treating crab burrows. Further research is underway to find the optimum (biological or chemical) larvicidal ingredient for the crab bait. Despite the ecological and logistical challenges of controlling the Aedes vectors of the dengue viruses and W. bancrofti in so many scattered islands, the French Polynesian experience indicates that relatively simple methods can be integrated and applied effectively and economically. Operationally, however, success also depends on a strong political commitment and on at-risk communities that are sufficiently motivated to maintain a good level of Aedes control.",2002,"Lardeux, F., Rivière, F., Séchan, Y., Loncke, S.",Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology,,96 (SUPPL. 2),S105-116,,French Polynesia,109,Contact PacELF at JCU,Vector Control,,English,,PacELF_109 Lardeux et al 2002 ATMP Control of the Aedes vectors of the dengue viruses and Wuchereria bancrofti the French Polynesian experience.pdf

314,Fiji,726,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Modeling the Impact and Costs of Semiannual Mass Drug Administration for Accelerated Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis,"The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) has a target date of 2020. This program is progressing well in many countries. However, progress has been slow in some countries, and others have not yet started their mass drug administration (MDA) programs. Acceleration is needed. We studied how increasing MDA frequency from once to twice per year would affect program duration and costs by using computer simulation modeling and cost projections. We used the LYMFASIM simulation model to estimate how many annual or semiannual MDA rounds would be required to eliminate LF for Indian and West African scenarios with varied pre-control endemicity and coverage levels. Results were used to estimate total program costs assuming a target population of 100,000 eligibles, a 3% discount rate, and not counting the costs of donated drugs. A sensitivity analysis was done to investigate the robustness of these results with varied assumptions for key parameters. Model predictions suggested that semiannual MDA will require the same number of MDA rounds to achieve LF elimination as annual MDA in most scenarios. Thus semiannual MDA programs should achieve this goal in half of the time required for annual programs. Due to efficiency gains, total program costs for semiannual MDA programs are projected to be lower than those for annual MDA programs in most scenarios. A sensitivity analysis showed that this conclusion is robust. Semiannual MDA is likely to shorten the time and lower the cost required for LF elimination in countries where it can be implemented. This strategy may improve prospects for global elimination of LF by the target year 2020.",2013,"Stolk, W.A., ten Bosch, Q.A., de Vlas, S.J., Fischer, P.U., Weil, G.J., Goldman, A.S.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,,7(1),e1984,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001984,Multicountry Global,314,Open  ,,,English,,PacELF_314 Stolk et al 2013 PLOS NTDs Modeling the Impact and Costs of Semiannual Mass Drug Administration for Accelerated Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis.pdf
315,Fiji,728,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,A single dose of doxycycline in combination with diethylcarbamazine for treatment of bancroftian filariasis,"Standard treatment of lymphatic filariasis with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is associated with systemic adverse reactions, thought to be due to the release of microfilariae material and Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria into the blood. Combination treatments with doxycycline for 3-8 weeks are more effective than standard treatment. However, long-term use of antibiotics may contribute to drug resistance and are not practical for use in remote areas. We assessed whether a single dose of doxycycline combined with the standard DEC regimen would reduce the incidence and severity of adverse reactions and increase the efficacy of standard treatment. Forty-four subjects from Tak Province were recruited into the randomized double-blind clinical trial study: 25 received DEC (300 mg) combined with a placebo, and 19 received DEC (300 mg) combined with doxycycline (200 mg). The incidences of adverse reactions to standard treatment were lower in the doxycycline group (45.5%) than in the placebo group (58.8%). Severe reactions occurred only in the placebo group (3 of 25 subjects). The severity of adverse reactions was significantly lower in the doxycycline group (mean score 0.45) than in the placebo group (mean score 1.17).

317,Fiji,730, ,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Doxycycline reduces plasma VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3 and improves pathology in lymphatic filariasis,"Lymphatic filariasis is a disease of considerable socioeconomic burden in the tropics. Presently used antifilarial drugs are able to strongly reduce transmission and will thus ultimately lower the burden of morbidity associated with the infection, however, a chemotherapeutic principle that directly induces a halt or improvement in the progression of the morbidity in already infected individuals would constitute a major lead. In search of such a more-effective drug to complement the existing ones, in an area endemic for bancroftian filariasis in Ghana, 33 microfilaremic and 18 lymphedema patients took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a 6-wk regimen of 200 mg/day doxycycline. Four months after doxycycline treatment, all patients received 150-200 lg/kg ivermectin and 400 mg albendazole. Patients were monitored for Wolbachia and microfilaria loads, antigenemia, filarial dance sign (FDS), dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels, and plasma levels of lymphangiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor-C [VEGF-C] and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 [(s)VEGFR-3]). Lymphedema patients were additionally monitored for stage (grade) of lymphedema and the circumferences of affected legs. Wolbachia load, microfilaremia, antigenemia, and frequency of FDS were significantly reduced in microfilaremic patients up to 24 mo in the doxycycline group compared to the placebo group. The mean dilation of supratesticular lymphatic vessels in doxycycline-treated patients was reduced significantly at 24 mo, whereas there was no improvement in the placebo group. Preceding clinical improvement, at 12 mo, the mean plasma levels of VEGF-C and sVEGFR-3 decreased significantly in the doxycycline-treated patients to a level close to that of endemic normal values, whereas there was no significant reduction in the placebo patients. The extent of disease in lymphedema patients significantly improved following doxycycline, with the mean stage of lymphedema in the doxycycline-treated patients being significantly lower compared to placebo patients 12 mo after treatment. The reduction in the stages manifested as better skin texture, a reduction of deep folds, and fewer deep skin folds. In conclusion, a 6-wk regimen of antifilarial treatment with doxycycline against W. bancrofti showed a strong macrofilaricidal activity and reduction in plasma levels of VEGF-C/sVEGFR-3, the latter being associated with amelioration of supratesticular dilated lymphatic vessels and with an improvement of pathology in lymphatic filariasis patients.",2006,"Debrah, A.Y., Mand, S., Specht, S., Marfo-Debrekyei, Y., Batsa, L., Pfarr, K., Larbi, J., Lawson, B., Taylor, M., Adjei, O., Hoerauf, A.",PLoS Pathogens,,2(9),829-843,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0020092,Multicountry Global,317,Open,PC,,English,,PacELF_317 Debrah et al 2006 PLOS PATHOGENS Doxycycline reduces VGF and improves pathology LF.pdf

The model estimates that the number of people currently at risk of infection decreased by 46% to 789 million through 2012.Important progress has been made in the global efforts to eliminate LF, but significant scale-up is required over the next 8 years to reach the 2020 elimination goal.",2014,"Hooper, P.J., Chu, B.K., Mikhailov, A., Ottesen, E.A., Bradley, M.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,,8(11),e3333,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003333,Multicountry Global,319,Open,LF activities,,English,,PacELF_319 Hooper et al 2014 PLOS NTDs Assessing Progress in Reducing the At-Risk Population after 13 Years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.pdf

The pre-experimental microfilarial infection rate and mean density in 20 c.mm. were 12.2 per cent. and 4.05. The follow-up (4th) survey included 1430 people. The microfilarial infection rate had risen from 2.7 per cent. to 5.5 per cent. in 4 years. The mean microfilarial density had risen from 0.36 to 0.50. For 507 people present at all four blood surveys the corresponding rates rose from 1.2 per cent. to 6.9 per cent. (originally 16.0 per cent.) and from 0.012 to 0.51 (originally 7.08). It is concluded that disease transmission on a significant scale is unlikely to have resumed yet. When known positive cases are considered alone, the proportion not cured by treatment with two courses of drugs appears to have risen from 7 per cent. to 35 per cent. in the 4 years since treatment. It is known, however, that about 40 per cent. of those apparently cured were still harbouring microfilariae in numbers too small for detection by the routine method used, and there has not been any significant increase in the true infection rate. The records of individual subjects show that some had become positive but these were balanced by others who had become negative. The mean mf.d. had, however, increased about 30 times. The pre-treatment mean microfilarial density among those cured by either one or two courses of drug was very highly significantly lower than among those not cured.

The microfilarial periodicities of 22 W. bancrofti antigen-positive volunteers were studied. Microfilariae (mf) were counted every hour for 24 h for 6 volunteers and every hour for 12 h (from 18:00 to 06:00) for 16 volunteers. At the same time as the preparation of mf test slides, indoor human landing catches of the vector mosquito, Anopheles farauti, were conducted to assess the vector biting activity. The time of peak microfilaraemia was 01:32 and the microfilarial periodicity index was 112.3, confirming the nocturnal periodicity of Wuchereria bancrofti in Vanuatu. Nearly all (98.5%) of the mf appeared during the time periods when A. farauti were collected.

The monthly manbiting rates (average biting density of vector mosquitoes per man per night) were observed over a two-year period to establish typical seasonal prevalence patterns. Observations on the frequency of feeding and the human blood index were combined to derive the manbiting habit. A daily survival rate was determined from the dissection of mosquito ovaries by Polovodova's age-grading method. The extrinsic cycle in the mosquito was not observed, and the value for this parameter was extracted from the literature. All parameters were combined to estimate the monthly variations in vectorial capacity of each of the vector species, and the vectorial capacities of the individual species were added together to give a total monthly vectorial capacity of the punctulatus complex in each locality. The results showed that malaria transmission can be perennial, with a period of more intense transmission between August and January in the southern area, and between September and February in the northern. A period of very low transmission can be expected between February/March and July/August.",1980,"Afifi, S. E., Spencer, M., Hudson, P.

Among 2,187 people with data on these manifestations, 1,144 were microfilaraemic, 78 had leg oedema, 356 had acute episodes and 919 were negative for all three. All possible combinations of the three manifestations were observed. The relationships between microfilaraemia and disease are found to be time-dependent. Microfilaraemia is a positive risk factor for leg oedema at lower ages, but a negative one at higher ages. Acute disease over a whole year is found to be positively associated with a point estimate of microfilaraemia. However, when considering incidence within a month of the time of the blood sample, a curvilinear relationship is found and people with low but positive microfilarial counts have the lowest incidence.

Mean levels generally increased with age in both sexes, with a tendency to plateau at the highest ages. However, there was a reduction among women of approximately reproductive age. Allowing for the tendency for aggregation to decrease with age, this reduction was statistically significant. However, a comparison of pregnant women and controls showed no evidence that the reduction is specifically related to pregnancy. Moreover, a simple differential equation model of microfilarial acquisition and loss suggests that age-specific patterns of exposure are also unlikely to be solely responsible. Therefore, we suggest that the observed reduction in microfilarial intensity may result from hormonal changes associated with female reproduction, possibly in combination with other factors.",1999,"Alexander, N.D.E., Grenfell, B.T.",Parasitology,,119,151-156,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182099004527,Papua New Guinea,444,Open via Publisher,,"Wuchereria bancrofti, age factors, sex factors, infection susceptibility",English,,PacELF_444 Alexander 1999b PARASITOLOGY Effect of pregnancy on LF Wb Mf loads S0031182099004527a.pdf

447,JCU,206,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Filarial worms reduce Plasmodium infectivity in mosquitoes,"BACKGROUND: Co-occurrence of malaria and filarial worm parasites has been reported, but little is known about the interaction between filarial worm and malaria parasites with the same Anopheles vector. Herein, we present data evaluating the interaction between Wuchereria bancrofti and Anopheles punctulatus in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Our field studies in PNG demonstrated that An. punctulatus utilizes the melanization immune response as a natural mechanism of filarial worm resistance against invading W. bancrofti microfilariae. We then conducted laboratory studies utilizing the mosquitoes Armigeres subalbatus and Aedes aegypti and the parasites Brugia malayi, Brugia pahangi, Dirofilaria immitis, and Plasmodium gallinaceum to evaluate the hypothesis that immune activation and/or development by filarial worms negatively impact Plasmodium development in co-infected mosquitoes. Ar. subalbatus used in this study are natural vectors of P. gallinaceum and B. pahangi and they are naturally refractory to B. malayi (melanization-based refractoriness). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mosquitoes were dissected and Plasmodium development was analyzed six days after blood feeding on either P. gallinaceum alone or after taking a bloodmeal containing both P. gallinaceum and B. malayi or a bloodmeal containing both P. gallinaceum and B. pahangi. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence and mean intensity of Plasmodium infections in two species of mosquito that had dual infections as compared to those mosquitoes that were infected with Plasmodium alone, and was independent of whether the mosquito had a melanization immune response to the filarial worm or not. However, there was no reduction in Plasmodium development when filarial worms were present in the bloodmeal (D. immitis) but midgut penetration was absent, suggesting that factors associated with penetration of the midgut by filarial worms likely are responsible for the observed reduction in malaria parasite infections. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results could have an impact on vector infection and transmission dynamics in areas where Anopheles transmit both parasites, i.e., the elimination of filarial worms in a co-endemic locale could enhance malaria transmission.",2011,"Aliota, M.T., Chen, C.-C., Dagoro, H., Fuchs, J.F., Christensen, B.M.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,,5(2),e963,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000963,Papua New Guinea,447,Open,,,English,,PacELF_447 Aliota et al 2011 PLOS NTD LF and malaria transmssion PNG out.pdf

Here we examine an artificially infected strain of Aedes polynesiensis, the primary vector of Wuchereria bancrofti, which is the causative agent of Lymphatic filariasis (LF) throughout much of the South Pacific. Embryonic microinjection was used to transfer the wAlbB infection from Aedes albopictus into an aposymbiotic strain of Ae. polynesiensis. The resulting strain (designated ""MTB"") experiences a stable artificial infection with high maternal inheritance. Reciprocal crosses of MTB with naturally infected wild-type Ae. polynesiensis demonstrate strong bidirectional incompatibility. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the MTB strain differ significantly relative to that of the wild-type, indicating an impaired ability to regulate oxidative stress. Following a challenge with Brugia pahangi, the number of filarial worms achieving the infective stage is significantly reduced in MTB as compared to the naturally infected and aposymbiotic strains. Survivorship of MTB differed significantly from that of the wild-type, with an interactive effect between survivorship and blood feeding. The results demonstrate a direct correlation between decreased ROS levels and decreased survival of adult female Aedes polynesiensis. The results are discussed in relation to the interaction of Wolbachia with ROS production and antioxidant expression, iron homeostasis and the insect immune system. We discuss the potential applied use of the MTB strain for impacting Ae. polynesiensis populations and strategies for reducing LF incidence in the South Pacific.",2012,"Andrews, E.S., Crain, P.R., Fu, Y., Howe, D.K., Dobson, S.L.",PLoS Pathogens,,8(12),e1003075,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003075,Multicountry Pacific,448,Open,,,English,,PacELF_448 Andrews et al 2012 PLOS PATHOGENS Reactive oxygen species production and Brugia pahangi survivorship in Aedes polynesiensis with artificial Wolbachia infection types.pdf

Major medical problems include malaria and bancroftian filariasis. An entomological survey conducted along an altitudinal transect from 170 to 1000m identified Anopheles koliensis as the predominant malaria vector below 650 m, with A. punctulatus dominating at the higher elevations. Proportions of mosquitoes with malaria circumsporozoite antigens diminished with increasing altitude, as did the proportion of mosquitoes infected with stage 3 larvae of Wuchereria bancrofti. These patterns are consistent with increases in the length of the extrinsic incubation period associated with the lower temperatures found at higher altitudes. Inoculation rates varied less regularly with altitude, owing to local variation in biting rates, but were sufficient even at the higher elevations to maintain a high parasite prevalence in the human population.

The group is comprised of 12 cryptic species that require DNA-based tools for species identification. From 1984 to 1998 surveys were carried out in northern Australia, Papua New Guinea and on islands in the southwest Pacific to determine the distribution of the A. punctulatus group. The results of these surveys have now been completed and have generated distribution data from more than 1500 localities through this region. Within this region several climatic and geographical barriers were identified that restricted species distribution and gene flow between geographic populations. This information was further assessed in light of a molecular phylogeny derived from the ssrDNA (18S). Subsequently, hypotheses have been generated on the evolution and distribution of the group so that future field and laboratory studies may be approached more systematically. This study suggested that the ability for widespread dispersal was found to have appeared independently in species that show niche-specific habitat preference (Anopheles farauti s.s. and A. punctulatus) and conversely in species that showed diversity in their larval habitat (Anopheles farauti 2). Adaptation to the monsoonal climate of northern Australia and southwest Papua New Guinea was found to have appeared independently in A. farauti s.s., A. farauti 2 and Anopheles farauti 3. Shared or synapomorphic characters were identified as saltwater tolerance (A. farauti s.s. and Anopheles farauti 7) and elevational affinities above 1500 m (Anopheles farauti 5, Anopheles farauti 6 and A. farauti 2).",2002,"Beebe, N.W., Cooper, R.D.",International Journal for Parasitology,,32(5),563-574,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0020-7519(01)00359-9,Multicountry Pacific,458,Open via Publisher,,,English,"Work locations Australia, Papua New Guinea and islands in the southwest Pacific",PacELF_458 Beebe and Cooper 2002 INT J PARASITOL Distirbution and evolution of An punctulatus Aus PNG.pdf

A total of 1,735 culicine mosquitoes, including Culex and Mansonia species, were dissected, but none were infected with filarial larvae. In contrast, Anopheles punctulatus and An. koliensis were found to be potential vectors: 7.3% of Anopheles were infected and the mean number of first- to third-stage larvae per infected mosquito was 2.7. Transmission indices varied significantly in five villages located within a 50-km radius of each other. Annual biting rates ranged from 4,789 to 48,020 bites/person/year; annual infective biting rates from 15 to 836/person/year; and annual transmission potential from 31 to 2,340 third-stage larvae/person/year. Monthly transmission potential and monthly infective biting rate varied significantly in each village, with the highest indices of transmission observed in villages nearest sites where puddles formed in river beds during the dry season. These data indicate that there is small area variation in the intensity and temporal pattern of filariasis transmission and that culicine mosquitoes are not important vectors of W. bancrofti in this area.",1996,"Bockarie, M., Kazura, J., Alexander, N., Dagoro, H., Bockarie, F., Perry, R., Alpers, M.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,54(6),577-581,,Papua New Guinea,471,Contact PacELF at JCU,"bites, transmission, modeling, seasons","vector mosquito, monthly biting rates, monthly infective biting rate, monthly transmission potentials,",English,,PacELF_471 Bockarie et al 1996b AJTMH Transmission dynamics LF E Sepik PNG.pdf

The biting habit of sporozoite-infected A. punctulatus was also investigated. The sporozoite rates for Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were 1.8 and 1.4% respectively, but only one (1.3%) of 76 females infected with P. falciparum was caught between 18:00 and 21:00. A significantly higher proportion (11.6%) of mosquitoes infected with P. vivax was caught in the same period. The late biting habit of mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum is discussed in relation to the differential biting habits of parous and nulliparous females. We conclude with a hypothesis that, in areas where Anopheles mosquitoes have a late-biting cycle and low parous rate, exposure to mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum during the pre-bedtime period (18:00-22:00) is very low. This hypothesis could explain why insecticide-treated bed nets protect children better in areas of seasonal transmission, where nulliparous females tend to predominate, than in areas of perennial transmission, where parous females are usually more numerous. The same hypothesis is compatible with the finding in Papua New Guinea that insecticide-impregnated bed nets are more protective against P. falciparum than against P. vivax malaria.",1996,"Bockarie, M.J., Alexander, N., Bockarie, F., Ibam, E., Barnish, G., Alpers, M.",Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,90(1),23-25,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0035-9203(96)90465-4,Papua New Guinea,473,Open via Publisher,,,English,,PacELF_473 Bockarie et al 1996 TRSTMH The late biting habit of parous Anopheles mosquitoes and pre-bedtime exposure of humans to infective female mosquitoes.pdf

This study compares one year post-treatment W. bancrofti infection rates of Anopheles punctulatus, the main vector of lymphatic filariasis in Papua New Guinea, using traditional dissection techniques and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based ELISA of a parasite-specific Ssp I repeat. A total of 633 mosquitoes in 35 batches were dissected. Six batches contained W. bancrofti-infected mosquitoes, giving a minimum infection rate of 0.9%. This value was not different than the actual infection rate, which was 9 (1.4%) of 633 mosquitoes (P = 0.48). The DNA was extracted from 47 pools containing a mean of 13.2 mosquitoes per pool. A total of 621 mosquitoes were processed for the PCR-ELISA, including 486 caught by human bait and 135 by light trap, which included both dead and live mosquitoes. Of 23 pools of alcohol-preserved human-bait mosquitoes, seven were positive by the PCR-ELISA, giving an infection rate identical to that obtained by dissection of individual mosquitoes (1.4%). The minimum infection rates for pools of light-trap mosquitoes found dead and alive were 2.7% (2 of 74) and 4.9% (3 of 61), respectively. These values did not differ from each other (P = 0.84), but the overall infection rate of light-trap mosquitoes was greater than that of mosquitoes captured by human bait (3.7% versus 1.4%; P = 0.09). These data indicate that the PCR-ELISA of a W. bancrofti Ssp I repeat using pools of mosquitoes is comparable to traditional dissection techniques for monitoring transmission intensity following introduction of mass chemotherapy.

In a village where mass treatment had been given, using 400 mu g/kg ivermectin plus 6 mg/kg diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC), we performed pre- and post-treatment collections of freshly blood-engorged mosquitoes from the same nine bedrooms. All blood-fed mosquitoes collected less than 4 days after mass treatment died within 9 days, whereas 67% of those collected before treatment survived for > 9 days. Comparison (using the log-rank test) of the survival curves for mosquitoes collected (i) before treatment, (ii) < 4 days after treatment, and (iii) 28 days after treatment, showed the survival rate of group (ii) to be significantly lower than the other two (chi(2) = 176, df = 2, P < 0.0001). Pre- and post-treatment all-night landing catches showed no reduction in human biting rates in the experimental village. In another village, where people were mass treated with ivermectin (400 mu g/kg) only, the survival rates of freshly blood-engorged An.punctulatus collected from bedroom resting-sites less than 1 day after treatment, were compared to similar collections carried out at the same time in a nearby village where people were not treated with ivermectin, The 48-h survival rate for the ivermectin-treated village was 31% compared to 94% for the other; this difference was highly significant (chi(2) = 32.42, df = 1, P < 0.0001). Mosquitoes fed 2 months post-treatment with DEC or collected 38 days post-treatment with ivermectin had normal survival rates.

Breaks in perennial transmission (failure to detect infective mosquitoes in four or more consecutive monthly collections) occurred in all 3 communities treated with DEC+IVR. Transmission was almost completely interrupted in 2 villages, where infective mosquitoes were not detected during 11 of the 12 months following treatment.

Obstructive filarial disease in the form of elephantiasis or hydrocele was not observed among the indigenous population. Anopheles species accounted for 91% of human-biting mosquitoes collected in the area. A total of 1126 mosquitoes were caught and dissected individually but none was infected with third-stage larvae (L3).

479,JCU,229,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Lymphatic filariasis in Papua New Guinea: prospects for elimination,"Lymphatic filariasis is a significant public health problem in several Pacific island countries. Papua New Guinea is one of the most populous countries in this region, and 39% of its residents are estimated to be infected with Wuchereria bancrofti. The Ministries of Health of the 22 islands and territories in the Pacific region are committed to taking action against lymphatic filariasis. Accordingly, a regional collaborative effort aimed at the control of filariasis has been organized under the auspices of a program referred to as PacELF. The main objective of PacELF is to eliminate filariasis as public health problem in the Pacific region by the year 2010, 10 years before global elimination of this infectious disease has been targeted. This contribution describes the epidemiology and ecological features of filariasis and prospects for its elimination in Papua New Guinea. The frequencies of microfilaremia, chronic lymphatic disease, and acute filarial morbidity in Papua New Guinea are higher than in many other endemic countries of the Pacific, Africa, and South America. All possible combinations of these three manifestations of filariasis exist. They occur independently of each other, and there is no association between chronic lymphatic disease and microfilarial status. Anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes are the main vectors throughout the country. Transmission intensity is heterogeneous and a major determinant of local patent infection and morbidity rates. Annual transmission potential and annual infective biting rates are positively associated with the village-specific microfilarial rate, mean intensity of microfilaremia, and prevalence of leg edema. Children and adults have similar worm burdens, assessed by circulating filarial antigen levels, in areas of high transmission, whereas worm burdens increase with age in areas of lower transmission. Intensity of exposure to infective third-stage larvae (L3) is significantly correlated with filarial antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production, possibly by a mechanism that alters APC function. Historical evidence suggests that residual insecticide spraying conducted for malaria control in some parts of the country interrupted transmission of W. bancrofti as it did in the Solomon Islands. Prospects for eliminating lymphatic filariasis in Papua New Guinea are good and may be achieved by the end of the second decade of the twenty-first century if an integrated control approach using mass drug administration with vector control is adopted.",2003,"Bockarie, M.J., Kazura, J.W.",Medical Microbiology and Immunology,,192(1),9-14,,Papua New Guinea,479,Contact PacELF at JCU,"MDA, vectors, bednets",,English,,PacELF_479 Bockarie and Kazura 2003 MED MICROBIOL IMMUNOL LF in PNG prospects for elimination.pdf

The availability of safe, single-dose, drug treatment regimens capable of suppressing microfilaremia to very low levels, along with improvements in techniques for diagnosing infection, has resulted in the targeting of this major mosquito-borne disease for global elimination. The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched in 2000 with the principal objective of breaking the cycles of transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia spp. through the application of annual mass drug administrations (MDAs) to entire at-risk populations. Although significant progress in initiating MDA programs in endemic countries has been made, emerging challenges to this approach have raised questions regarding the effectiveness of using MDA alone to eliminate I-F without the inclusion of supplementary vector control.

490,JCU,240,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Sex differentials in susceptibility to lymphatic filariasis and implications for maternal child immunity,"This paper reviews epidemiological data to see if there are sex differentials in prevalence, density and clinical pathology due to lymphatic filariasis. Of 53 studies from Africa, South East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and The Americas, 43 showed a lower mean prevalence of infection in females than in males. Prevalence is consistently lower in women of reproductive age and this is statistically significant in 16 of 32 studies classified by age and sex. Density of infection is also lower in the reproductive age but may be higher in children and in older women. Clinical disease is also lower in women and pathology has a later age of onset and rise to peak prevalence than in males. The paper assesses the evidence that lower rates of infection and clinical pathology are due to less exposure of females to infective vectors. It seems unlikely that exposure alone could account for these differences which are observed for both bancroftian and brugian filariasis, irrespective of periodicity. Several investigators have suggested that females have increased resistance to infection and this is supported by serological studies showing high antibody positivity to adult worm antigens in females. The review concludes that the association with the reproductive years suggests a pregnancy-associated mechanism. This has important implications for maternal-fetal interactions and maternal filarial infection may influence the development of immunity in children.",1990,"Brabin, L.",Epidemiology and Infection,,105(2),335-353,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268800047932,Multicountry Global,490,Contact PacELF at JCU,epidemiology,,English,,PacELF_490 Brabin 1990 EPIDEMIOL INF sex differences in susceptibility to LF review.pdf

CI has received attention for use in applied strategies to control insect vectors of disease. Thus, to understand both naturally occurring Wolbachia invasions and evaluate potential applied strategies, it is important to understand Wolbachia interactions with its host, including impacts on fitness and the CI level. In this study, we examined for an effect of Wolbachia on survivorship, developmental time, sex ratio, longevity, fecundity, and egg hatch of Aedes polynesiensis Marks, which is the primary vector of Wuchereria bancrofti in the South Pacific. In this study, we have compared strains of A. polynesiensis that are naturally and artificially infected with Wolbachia and additional strains that are aposymbiotic (Wolbachia removed to generate an uninfected strain). Artificially infected strains were observed to have increased larval mortality and decreased adult longevity when compared with aposymbiotic strains. Naturally infected strains were observed to have decreased larval mortality, pupal mortality, increased adult longevity, and a larger adult size when compared with aposymbiotic strains. Artificially infected males that were 4 wk old were able to induce high rates of CI, similar to young males.

492,JCU,242,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Population genetic structure of Aedes polynesiensis in the Society Islands of French Polynesia: implications for control using a Wolbachia-based autocidal strategy,"BACKGROUND: Aedes polynesiensis is the primary vector of Wuchereria bancrofti in the South Pacific and an important vector of dengue virus. An improved understanding of the mosquito population genetics is needed for insight into the population dynamics and dispersal, which can aid in understanding the epidemiology of disease transmission and control of the vector. In light of the potential release of a Wolbachia infected strain for vector control, our objectives were to investigate the microgeographical and temporal population genetic structure of A. polynesiensis within the Society Islands of French Polynesia, and to compare the genetic background of a laboratory strain intended for release into its population of origin. METHODS: A panel of eight microsatellite loci were used to genotype A. polynesiensis samples collected in French Polynesia from 2005-2008 and introgressed A. polynesiensis and Aedes riversi laboratory strains. Examination of genetic differentiation was performed using F-statistics, STRUCTURE, and an AMOVA. BAYESASS was used to estimate direction and rates of mosquito movement. RESULTS: FST values, AMOVA, and STRUCTURE analyses suggest low levels of intra-island differentiation from multiple collection sites on Tahiti, Raiatea, and Maupiti. Significant pair-wise FST values translate to relatively minor levels of inter-island genetic differentiation between more isolated islands and little differentiation between islands with greater commercial traffic (i.e., Tahiti, Raiatea, and Moorea). STRUCTURE analyses also indicate two population groups across the Society Islands, and the genetic makeup of Wolbachia infected strains intended for release is similar to that of wild-type populations from its island of origin, and unlike that of A. riversi. CONCLUSIONS: The observed panmictic population on Tahiti, Raiatea, and Moorea is consistent with hypothesized gene flow occurring between islands that have relatively high levels of air and maritime traffic, compared to that of the more isolated Maupiti and Tahaa.

As part of current global campaign, mass drug administration (MDA) has effectively reduced lymphatic filiariasis prevalence, but mosquito vector biology can complicate the MDA strategy. In some regions, there is evidence that the goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone. Obligate vector mosquitoes provide additional targets for breaking the LF transmission cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector throughout much of the South Pacific, Aedes polynesiensis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in an A. polynesiensis strain ('CP' strain) that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays demonstrate that CP males are equally competitive, resulting in population elimination when CP males are introduced into wild type A. polynesiensis populations.

While doses as low as 20 mug/kg could effect transient microfilarial (mf) clearance, higher dosages induced greater and more sustained mf reduction. The single dose of 400 mug/kg yieldcd maximal responses, but a number of practical considerations suggest that either 400 mug/kg or 200 mug/kg doses would be acceptable for use in LF control programmes. Associated safety assessments indicate that adverse clients, which occur commonly following treatment of microfilaracmic individuals, develop not because of drug toxicity but because of host inflammatory responses to dying microfilariae killed by the ivermectin treatment.

508,JCU,254, ,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Barrier screens: a method to sample blood-fed and host-seeking exophilic mosquitoes,"BACKGROUND: Determining the proportion of blood meals on humans by outdoor-feeding and resting mosquitoes is challenging. This is largely due to the difficulty of finding an adequate and unbiased sample of resting, engorged mosquitoes to enable the identification of host blood meal sources. This is particularly difficult in the south-west Pacific countries of Indonesia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea where thick vegetation constitutes the primary resting sites for the exophilic mosquitoes that are the primary malaria and filariasis vectors. METHODS: Barrier screens of shade-cloth netting attached to bamboo poles were constructed between villages and likely areas where mosquitoes might seek blood meals or rest. Flying mosquitoes, obstructed by the barrier screens, would temporarily stop and could then be captured by aspiration at hourly intervals throughout the night. RESULTS: In the three countries where this method was evaluated, blood-fed females of Anopheles farauti, Anopheles bancroftii, Anopheles longirostris, Anopheles sundaicus, Anopheles vagus, Anopheles kochi, Anopheles annularis, Anopheles tessellatus, Culex vishnui, Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia spp were collected while resting on the barrier screens. In addition, female Anopheles punctulatus and Armigeres spp as well as male An. farauti, Cx. vishnui, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Aedes species were similarly captured.

Although the proportion of P. vivax sporozoite antigen-positive mosquitoes compared with all sporozoite-positive mosquitoes did not change from 1986 to 1987, the proportion of P. vivax-positive mosquitoes of the VK247 polymorph decreased significantly from 34% to 11% (5 of 45) in 1987. In 1986, 61% (47 of 77) of humans tested had IgGs that recognized the VK247 CS repeat, while only 26% (22 of 84) had IgGs that recognized the VK210 CS repeat.

The impact of untreated bednets on the prevalence of Wuchereria bancrofti (Cobbold) (Nematoda: Filarioidea) infection and disease was investigated on Bagabag island in Papua New Guinea, where both malaria and filariasis are transmitted by the same vector mosquitoes of the Anopheles punctulatus Dönitz group (Diptera: Culicidae). Community-wide surveys were conducted recording demographic characteristics including bednet usage. Physical examinations for hydrocoele and lymphoedema were performed and blood samples assessed for filarial and malaria parasites. Mosquitoes were sampled using the all-night landing catch method and individually dissected to determine W. bancrofti infection and infective rates. Bednet usage among residents was 61% and the mean age of users (25.6 years) was similar to non-users (22.5 years). Anopheles farauti Laveran was the only species were found to contain filarial larvae: 2.7% infected (all stages), 0.5% infective (L3). The overall W. bancrofti microfilaraemia and antigenaemia rates were 28.5% and 53.1%, respectively. Bednet users had lower prevalence of W. bancrofti microfilaraemia, antigenaemia and hydrocoele rates than non-users. In comparison, untreated bednets had no effect on the prevalence and intensity of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infections.

Seven hundred and forty-eight microfilaraemic patients were enrolled in 7 dose-finding and 8 comparative studies. Administered as a single dose, ivermectin induced nearly complete clearance of microfilariae from the blood from the first day to 30 days post-treatment, followed by gradual recurrence of microfilaraemia and increase in its intensity. Higher doses of ivermectin showed greater clearance effects and maintained lower microfilaraemia levels for a longer time. The adverse reactions caused by the drug were flu-like, transient, generally mild and well tolerated by patients. The frequency and intensity of adverse reactions were strongly associated with pretreatment microfilaria counts in the blood, but independent of dose.

Microfilarial (mf) density and serum levels of W. bancrofti phosphorylcholine-containing antigen (PC-Ag) in individuals were used as indirect measures of adult worm burden. These parasitological data were collected from 126 subjects > 4 years of age at two time points, 12 months apart, prior to the administration of the antifilarial drug diethylcarbamazine (DEC). No significant changes in levels of mf density were observed for the study population between these two time points. However, significant changes in the levels of circulating PC-Ag were noted in subjects ≤ 20 years of age, but not in subjects > 20 years of age, between these two time points. The apparent shorter half life of circulating PC-Ag compared to that of mf makes antigenemia a more sensitive measure of the dynamics of adult worm populations. These data are discussed in terms of a basic mathematical model describing the dynamics of adult worm populations in relation to their life expectancy and attrition of larvae during establishment. Consideration of these data in the context of this simple immigration/death model suggests that the differences observed in patterns of change in intensity of infection between subjects ≤ 20 years old and those > 20 years old may be consistent with the acquisition of resistance to superinfection with increasing age.",1991,"Day, K.P., Grenfell, B., Spark, R., Kazura, J.W., Alpers, M.P.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,44(5),518-527,,Papua New Guinea,547,Contact PacELF at JCU,Age population,,English,,PacELF_547 Day et al 1991 AJTMH Age specific patterns of change LF PNG.pdf

The number of hydroceles treated was 83. We developed and evaluated a much needed clinical classification of hydroceles based on four criteria: Type (uni/bilateral); Side (left/right); Stage of enlargement of the scrotum rated from I to VI; Grade of burial of the penis rated from 0 to 4. It lead to the conclusion that 1) A Stage I or II hydrocele, associated with Grade 0 or 1 penis burial could be considered a ""Simple Hydrocele"". The surgical treatment is simple with no anticipated early complication. WHO Level II of health care structure seems adapted. 2) A Stage III or IV hydrocele associated with Grade 2, 3 or 4 penis burial could be considered a ""Complicated Hydrocele"". The operation is longer, more complicated and the possibility of occurrence of complications seems greater. A level III health care facility would be more adapted under the normal functioning of the health system. We conclude that a standardized clinical classification of hydroceles based on the Stage of enlargement of the scrotum and the Grade of burial of the penis appears to be a useful tool to guide the decision about the level of care and the surgical technique required. We use the same classification for penoscrotal lymphoedema. A decision tree is presented for the management of hydroceles in lymphatic filariasis endemic countries which could usefully complement the ""Algorithm for management of scrotal swelling"" proposed by WHO in 2002.

Determination of blood microfilarial (mf) density was carried out on days 0, 7, 14, 30, 90 and 180 using the membrane filtration technique. Clinical signs and side effects were noted during the 3 days following treatment. Complete clearance of microfilaremia was observed in two carriers (negativation rate 14%). A decrease of mf density was noted in all of the 14 carriers, ranging from 35.2 to 99.2% (median 78.75%). The percentage decrease in mf density, determined for the whole group from the geometric mean of the 14 mf counts, was 86% by day 7 and reached 95% by day 180. Side effects were observed in 10 patients (71%) of whom 3 only were unable to perform usual activities for less than 24 hours. Though it induced an incomplete initial mf clearance, a single DEC 3 mg/kg dose was effective in reducing about 90% of the microfilaremia and in sustaining this reduction over a period of six months. Such long-term reduction (comparable to that observed in W. bancrofti carriers treated with a daily DEC 6 mg/kg dose during 12 days) is likely responsible for the consistent decrease of total mf counts observed in the Tahitian population which has been treated for years with single DEC doses given every six months.",1990,"Cartel, J.-L., Celerier, P., Spiegel, A., Burucoa, C., Roux, J.-F.",Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health,,21(3),465-470,,French Polynesia,571,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,English,,PacELF_571 Cartel et al 1990 Southeast_Asian_journal_of_tropical_medicine_and_public_health-_465_to_470.pdf

Forty male microfilariae (mf) carriers between 18 and 50 years of age, in whom mf density was greater than or equal to 20 mf/ml, were treated twice at a one-year interval. Twelve months after the second treatment, in carriers who were given a dose greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/kg, mean mf density was 4-7% of the initial pretreatment mf density. Therefore, several successive annual treatments with single doses greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/kg of ivermectin should result in reducing mf densities to a very low level. Nevertheless, at 9 months after the second treatment, residual parasitaemia ranged from 1 to 2182 mf/ml (median 85) in 30 patients. Finally, in patients with pretreatment mf counts less than or equal to 150 mf/ml, mean mf density was 2.8 and 8.9 mf/ml, respectively, during the 2 six-month periods following treatment, while in patients with pretreatment mf densities greater than 150 mf/ml (median 1500) it was 92.3 and 334.1 mf/ml during the same periods. These results suggest that, when implementing filariasis control programmes, the best strategy might be administration of several treatments with a single dose of ivermectin every 6 months to the entire population, at least in French Polynesia.

In the development of a novel control tool, the response of Ae. polynesiensis to six different colours (three solid fabrics, two patterned fabrics and a plastic tarp) was measured using a digital photographic system. Adult mosquitoes were placed into an environmental chamber and allowed to choose between a white target and one of six experimental targets. Mosquito landing frequency and landing duration were calculated. Adult female Ae. polynesiensis preferred all of the experimental targets to the white control target. Mosquito landing frequency was highest for the solid targets (black, navy blue and red) followed in turn by the two colour pattern targets and the polyethylene target. Mosquito landing duration was greater for experimental targets when compared with white control targets. Mosquito landing frequencies did not change over time during the course of the assay. The response of male Ae. polynesiensis was also measured when exposed to a 100% cotton black target. Male mosquitoes preferred the black target to the white control target, although at levels lower than that observed in female mosquitoes.

Despite decades of ongoing mass drug administration (MDA) in the region, some island nations have not yet achieved the threshold levels of microfilaremia established by the World Health Organization for eliminating transmission. Previously, the generation of a novel Aedes polynesiensis strain (CP) infected with an exogenous type of Wolbachia has been described. The CP mosquito is cytoplasmically incompatible (i.e., effectively sterile) when mated with wildtype mosquitoes, and a strategy was proposed for the control of A. polynesiensis populations by repeated, inundative releases of CP males to disrupt fertility of wild females. Such a strategy could lead to suppression of the vector population and subsequently lead to a reduction in the transmission of filarial worms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CP males and F1 male offspring from wild-caught A. polynesiensis females exhibit near equal mating competitiveness with F1 females under semi-field conditions.

Following the World Health Assembly resolution in 1997, the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched. In the Pacific, the World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented from 1999, the Pacific Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PacELF) bringing together the 22 countries and territories, in a common effort to eliminate the disease. The strategy is based on Mass Drug Administration (MDA); in annual single dose during 5 years of a Diethycarbamazine/Albendazole association distributed to all the population at risk. Among the 22 countries and territories of the Pacific, 16 are endemic and 6 are non endemic. The classification is based according to the filarian antigen prevalence upper or lower than 1%. MDA are decided when the rate of the filarian antigen prevalence is > 1%. The objective of PacELF is to reduce this rate down to < 1%, threshold under which the transmission is supposed to be stopped. From 1999 to 2007, 14 of the 16 endemic countries organized MDA. Eleven of them completed the cycle of 5 treatments and even beyond. But, these MDA reached only 19% of the at risk population, because of logistic difficulties in Papua New Guinea, the most populated country in the Pacific. The investigations carried out in sentinel sites showed a public health impact, by the fall of the number of microfilaria carriers, often down to a rate < 1%. However the rate of circulating antigen prevalence remains often above the required threshold of 1%. Prevalence surveys carried out in 2007, in different endemic countries, revealed the necessity to intensify efforts and to refine strategy for elimination of FL from the Pacific. A lot of progress were obtained, but few problems were identified. Reflexions are imperative and in progress about: the MDA coverage rates while at the same time a certain lassitude appears in the populations and among health staff, the methods to evaluate the effectiveness of MDA, the reliability of the diagnostic tools to decide of the stop of MDA and to certify the absence of the transmission, the relevance of univocal biological criteria for the whole Pacific area, the need for an active surveillance during several years after stopping MDA, particularly in the countries affected by the very efficient vector Aedes polynesiensis. Seven years after its launching, despite undeniable success, the PacELF program did not achieve its very ambitious goal of stopping the transmission. Three years before its term, strong efforts have to be done and additional strategies be implemented. However; it is reasonable to expect the prolongation of the program in order to achieve the final objective. Beyond, in some countries, it will be still necessary to ensure a sustained global drug pressure and an active surveillance to prevent the re-emergence of the disease.",2008,"Chanteau, S., Roux, J.F.",Bulletin de la Societe de Pathologie Exotique,,101(3),254-260,,Multicountry Pacific,597,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,French,,PacELF_597 Chanteau and Roux 2008.pdf

610,JCU,308,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Malaria vectors of Papua New Guinea,"Understanding malaria transmission in Papua New Guinea (PNG) requires exact knowledge of which Anopheles species are transmitting malaria and is complicated by the cryptic species status of many of these mosquitoes. To identify the malaria vectors in PNG we studied Anopheles specimens from 232 collection localities around human habitation throughout PNG (using CO(2) baited light traps and human bait collections). A total of 22,970 mosquitoes were individually assessed using a Plasmodium sporozoite enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to identify Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae circumsporozoite proteins. All mosquitoes were identified to species by morphology and/or PCR. Based on distribution, abundance and their ability to develop sporozoites, we identified five species as major vectors of malaria in PNG. These included: Anopheles farauti, Anopheles hinesorum (incriminated here, to our knowledge, for the first time), Anopheles farauti 4, Anopheles koliensis and Anopheles punctulatus. Anopheles longirostris and Anopheles bancroftii were also incriminated in this study. Surprisingly, An. longirostris showed a high incidence of infections in some areas. A newly identified taxon within the Punctulatus Group, tentatively called An. farauti 8, was also found positive for circumsporozoite protein. These latter three species, together with Anopheles karwari and Anopheles subpictus, incriminated in other studies, appear to be only minor vectors, while Anopheles farauti 6 appears to be the major vector in the highland river valleys (>1500 m above sea level). The nine remaining Anopheles species found in PNG have been little studied and their bionomics are unknown; most appear to be uncommon with limited distribution and their possible role in malaria transmission has yet to be determined.",2009,"Cooper, R.D., Waterson, D.G.E., Frances, S.P., Beebe, N.W., Pluess, B., Sweeney, A.W.",International Journal for Parasitology,,39(13),1495-1501,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.05.009,Papua New Guinea,610,Open via Publisher,,,English,,PacELF_610 Cooper et al 2009 Int J Parasitol Malaria vectors of Papua New Guinea.pdf

To test this hypothesis in bancroftian lymphatic filariasis, pedigree data were collected twice during an 18-year period from an isolated Polynesian population living on a Pacific island where lymphatic filariasis is endemic. METHODS: Using variance-component analysis, we examined the contribution of shared genetic and environmental effects on host clinical and immune responses to filarial infection, along with potential confounding determinants. RESULTS: Sex was found to have a negligible influence on heritability estimates, but shared-household effects accounted for up to 32% of host variability. After accounting for these shared-household effects, heritability estimates suggested that levels of microfilariae and circulating adult worm antigen, as well as host eosinophil and immunoglobulin G antibody responses to larval and adult worm antigens, were highly heritable (range of heritability estimates, 0.15-0.84).

As the global prevalence of infection was not known in New Caledonia (NC), a serosurvey study was conducted by determining the prevalence of circulating filarial antigens, as recommended by the World Health Organization. FINDINGS: A cross sectional study on a 2 degree stratified sample was carried out from June to November 2013. Inclusion criteria were: individuals aged 2 to 80 y/o, who had been hospitalized or sought medical care for a non-infectious cause and who had been living in NC for more than 6 months. LF antigenic detection was performed using the immunocromatographic BinaxNOW filariasis card test (ICT). Among the 1,035 individuals tested, 7 were antigenic. The overall LF antigenic prevalence was 0.62% (CI 95% [0.60-0.63]). All patients were unrelated to each other; none of them presented clinical symptoms of LF. Four of the 7 ICT positive patients reported having travelled to LF endemic areas, 2 patients had never traveled outside NC and the last one had only traveled in non-endemic areas. For the 7 ICT positive patients, the research of microfilariae in blood smears and filarial DNA by PCR was negative. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of filarial antigenemia in NC is less than 1%, the threshold that defines the filarial endemic areas for WHO. Nevertheless, as two patients who had never travelled outside NC and one who had only travelled to non-endemic areas were antigenic, we cannot conclude that NC is totally free of LF.",2015,"Daures, M., Champagnat, J., Pfannstiel, A., Ringuenoire, F., Grangeon, J.-P., Musso, D.",Parasites and Vectors,,8(1),102,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-0713-9,New Caledonia,617,Open  ,Lymphatic filariasis; New-Caledonia; Pacific; Serosurvey,"albendazole; diethylcarbamazine; helminth DNA; parasite antigen; adolescent; adult; aged; child; cross-sectional study; female; filariasis; human; major clinical study; male; microfilaria (nematode larva); middle aged; New Caledonia; polymerase chain reaction; Review; seroprevalence; single drug dose; blood; diagnostic test; Elephantiasis, Filarial; immunoaffinity chromatography; Antigens, Helminth; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Humans; Immunochromatography; New Caledonia; Seroepidemiologic Studies",English,,PacELF_617 Daures et al 2015 Parasites and Vectors LF serosurvey New Caledonia s13071-015-0713-9.pdf

This paper describes results of a longitudinal study of changes in levels of PC-Ag in response to diethylcarbamazine (DEC) therapy as measured by two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) and Western blotting. One hundred thirty-two residents of a bancroftian filariasis-endemic area of Papua New Guinea (PNG) were treated with a 72 mg/kg dose of DEC. A macrofilaricidal effect was seen with this dose of DEC as 34% of the treated subjects had localized side effects and long-term decreases in microfilariae (mf) counts were observed 12 months after treatment. The PC-Ag levels were reduced to 72%, 52%, and 51% of pretreatment values at 21 days and at six and 12 months after treatment. These decreases, observed by IRMA, were specifically associated with loss of the Mr 200,000 PC-Ag detected by immunoadsorption and Western blotting. From drug treatment data, the maximum half-life of PC-Ag in circulation was calculated to be 50 days, assuming a first-order decay process. This maximum half-life indicates that persistent antigenemia observed in the majority of treated subjects could only result from the survival of adult worms. In the absence of methods to directly demonstrate W. bancrofti adult worms, detection of serum PC-Ag levels provides a sensitive indirect measure of the dynamics of adult worm populations. This serological measurement may be useful in optimizing the macrofilaricidal and therapeutic effects of DEC and in assessing the macrofilaricidal action of new antifilarial drugs and immunological interventions.",1991,"Day, K.P., Spark, R., Garner, P., Raiko, A., Wenger, J.D., Weiss, N., Mitchell, G.F., Alpers, M.P., Kazura, J.W.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,44(5),528-535,,Papua New Guinea,622,Contact PacELF at JCU,DEC,,English,,PacELF_622 Day et al 1991 AJTMH Serological evaluation of macrofilaricidal effects of DEC in LF PNG.pdf

Lymphatic filariasis is targeted for global elimination by 2020 with an earlier target of 2010 for the Pacific Island countries. No surveillance protocol for confirming filariasis elimination in small island countries has yet been agreed evaluated. Currently recommended surveillance strategies for confirming lymphatic filariasis elimination are not ideal for small Pacific countries. Relying on occasional surveys to detect an increasingly rare health condition has inherent epidemiological weaknesses. Characteristics of effective surveillance for confirming filariasis elimination would include adequate sensitivity for detecting residual transmission, ongoing population scrutiny, and integration within a resource-sensitive system that includes other important conditions requiring public health surveillance. We propose that acute adenolymphangitis (ALA) may prove a suitable surveillance condition.

Anophelines are generally characterized as poor vectors due to an inability to support development at low densities. However, it is important to understand the potential for transmission in natural vectors to maximize the success of elimination efforts. Primary vectors in Papua New Guinea (n = 1209) were dissected following exposure to microfilaremic blood (range 8-233 mf/20 microl). We examined density dependent and species-specific parasite prevalence, intensity and yield, barriers to parasite development as well as impacts on mosquito survival. We observed strikingly different parasite prevalence and yield among closely related species. Prevalence of infective stage larvae (L3s) ranged from 4.2% to 23.7% in An. punctulatus, 24.5% to 68.6% in An. farauti s.s. and 61.9% to 100% in An. hinesorum at low and high density exposures, respectively. Injection experiments revealed the greatest barrier to parasite development involved passage from the midgut into the hemocoel. The ratio of L3 to ingested mf at low densities was higher in An. hinesorum (yield = 1.0) and An. farauti s.s. (yield = 0.5) than has been reported in other anopheline vectors. There was a negative relationship between mosquito survival and bloodmeal mf density. In An. farauti s.s., increased parasite yield and survival at low densities suggest greater competence at low microfilaremias. In Papua New Guinea the likelihood of transmission will be strongly influenced by vector composition and changes in the mf reservoir as a result of elimination efforts.

Exemples choisis en Polynésie française = [Importance of mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) population genetic studies in medical entomology. Examples in French Polynesia]","[Some pathogens are known to be transmitted to humans by hematophagous insects. Control of diseases caused by arthropod-borne pathogens has usually been carried out by vector control using insecticides. The response of many vectors to insecticidal pressures often results in selection of resistant populations. Under field conditions, resistance is usually controlled by genes. Susceptibility or resistance to pathogens are usually determined by relatively simple genetic mechanisms. The frequency of such genes within a population will be influenced by evolutionary forces and interpopulation differences in levels of susceptibility to pathogens can be estimated. In view to understand the evolution of selected traits (insecticide resistance or vector capacity), analyses of gene flow provide information on population local dispersion patterns which is critical in vector control, indicating the distance of dispersal of vectors. Given that mosquitoes colonize various restricted and differentiated habitats, studies of mosquito populations appear especially promising for the understanding of vector genetic structure, vector transmission, disease epidemiology and disease control. Knowledge of patterns of gene flow and dispersal rates are useful to define geographic structure of mosquito populations from French Polynesia in relation with the transmission of a parasite (Bancroftian filariasis worm) or a virus (dengue viruses) or with their capacity to resist to insecticides. (1) Experimental infections of various geographic strains of Aedes polynesiensis for Wuchereria bancrofti show differences in the vectorial efficiency related to the geographic origin of the mosquito strain. Mosquitoes were more efficient intermediate hosts when infected with sympatric W. bancrofti. Mosquito strains from the Society archipelago developed the highest proportion of infective stage larvae and exhibited the lowest mortality rate. Isoenzyme frequency differences among Ae. polynesiensis populations confirms the genetic divergence of geographic isolated populations from crab holes. (2) A study on the genetic structure of Aedes aegypti, a vector of dengue viruses, shows a low level of genetic exchanges between mosquito populations. Genetic differentiation is probably due to insecticidal pressure which tends to structure mosquitoes for their oral susceptibility to dengue type 2 virus. The occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fryer in French Polynesia during the last few years was likely due to the dispersal of dengue viruses via viremic people rather than via infected vectors. (3) The analysis of the distribution of insecticide resistance genes in relation to genetic structure and gene now in Culex quinquefasciatus show that the frequency of resistance genes to organophosphorous insecticides is correlated to human displacements. The resistance genes have first been imported in French Polynesia through the international airport and dispersal of these genes through other islands was proceeded lia the local commercial traffic.]",1999,"Failloux, A.-B., Rodhain, F.",Annales de la Societe Entomologique de France,,35(1),1-16,,French Polynesia,651,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,French,,PacELF_651 Failloux and Rodhain 1999 ANN SOC ENTOMOL FR.pdf

Vanuatu is one of the first countries to initiate this program as part of the Global Program for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis, based on a five-year annual mass drug administration (MDA) of albendazole and diethylcarbamazine and complemented in Vanuatu by extensive coverage with bed nets. This paper reports results of 561 persons tested at eight sentinel sites following two years of MDA. Coverage was 72% and bed net use was more than 70%. Antigen prevalence was reduced by 63% (from 22% to 8%) and prevalence of microfilaremia prevalence was reduced by 93% (from 12% to 0.8%).

However, a major unresolved question remains: what are reasonable stopping points for these programmes? Recent theoretical work has highlighted how the ecological complexity and heterogeneity inherent in the transmission dynamics of macroparasites can result in elimination thresholds that vary between local communities. Here, we examine the empirical evidence for this hypothesis and its implications for the global elimination of the major macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis, by applying a novel Bayesian computer simulation procedure to fit a dynamic model of the transmission of this parasitic disease to field data from nine villages with different ecological and geographical characteristics. Baseline lymphatic filariasis microfilarial age-prevalence data from three geographically distinct endemic regions, across which the major vector populations implicated in parasite transmission also differed, were used to fit and calibrate the relevant vector-specific filariasis transmission models. Ensembles of parasite elimination thresholds, generated using the Bayesian fitting procedure, were then examined in order to evaluate site-specific heterogeneity in the values of these thresholds and investigate the ecological factors that may underlie such variability",2010,"Gambhir, M., Bockarie, M., Tisch, D., Kazura, J., Remais, J., Spear, R., Michael, E.",BMC Biology,,8,22,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-8-22,Multicountry Global,661,Open  ,"modeling, MDA",,English,,PacELF_661 Gambhir et al 2010 BMC BIOLOGY Heterogeneity in elimination thresholds LF.pdf
662,JCU,359,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Complex ecological dynamics and eradicability of the vector borne macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis","BACKGROUND: The current global efforts to control the morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases affecting developing countries--such as HIV/AIDS, polio, tuberculosis, malaria and the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)-have led to an increasing focus on the biological controllability or eradicability of disease transmission by management action. Here, we use an age-structured dynamical model of lymphatic filariasis transmission to show how a quantitative understanding of the dynamic processes underlying infection persistence and extinction is key to evaluating the eradicability of this macroparasitic disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the persistence and extinction dynamics of lymphatic filariasis by undertaking a numerical equilibrium analysis of a deterministic model of parasite transmission, based on varying values of the initial L3 larval density in the system. The results highlighted the likely occurrence of complex dynamics in parasite transmission with three major outcomes for the eradicability of filariasis. First, both vector biting and worm breakpoint thresholds are shown to be complex dynamic entities with values dependent on the nature and magnitude of vector-and host specific density-dependent processes and the degree of host infection aggregation prevailing in endemic communities. Second, these thresholds as well as the potential size of the attractor domains and hence system resilience are strongly dependent on peculiarities of infection dynamics in different vector species. Finally, the existence of multiple stable states indicates the presence of hysteresis nonlinearity in the filariasis system dynamics in which infection thresholds for infection invasion are lower but occur at higher biting rates than do the corresponding thresholds for parasite elimination. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The variable dynamic nature of thresholds and parasite system resilience reflecting both initial conditions and vector species-infection specificities, and the existence of hysteresis loop phenomenon, suggests that eradication of filariasis may require taking a more flexible and locally relevant approach to designing elimination programmes compared to the current command and control approach advocated by the global programme.",2008,"Gambhir, M., Michael, E.",PLoS ONE,,3(8),e2874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002874,Multicountry Global,662,Open  ,,,English,,"PacELF_662 Gambhir Michael 2008 PLOS ONE mplex ecological dynamics and eradicability of the vector borne macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis.pdf"

A diagnostic tool is needed to determine when the prevalence levels have decreased to a point that MDA campaigns can be discontinued without the threat of recrudescence. A six-country study was conducted assessing the performance of seven diagnostic tests, including tests for microfilariae (blood smear, PCR), parasite antigen (ICT, Og4C3) and antifilarial antibody (Bm14, PanLF, Urine SXP). One community survey and one school survey were performed in each country. A total of 8,513 people from the six countries participated in the study, 6,443 through community surveys and 2,070 through school surveys. Specimens from these participants were used to conduct 49,585 diagnostic tests. Each test was seen to have both positive and negative attributes, but overall, the ICT test was found to be 76% sensitive at detecting microfilaremia and 93% specific at identifying individuals negative for both microfilariae and antifilarial antibody; the Og4C3 test was 87% sensitive and 95% specific. We conclude, however, that the ICT should be the primary tool recommended for decision-making about stopping MDAs. As a point-of-care diagnostic, the ICT is relatively inexpensive, requires no laboratory equipment, has satisfactory sensitivity and specificity and can be processed in 10 minutes-qualities consistent with programmatic use.

Fifty-three adolescents, 25 LF infected and 28 LF non-infected, in age and sex-matched groups, using the Binax ICT rapid card test for filarial antigen were recruited to the study. None of the participants had overt signs of lymphedema. Lymphedema assessment measures were used to assess lower limb tissue compressibility (tonometry), limb circumference (tape measure), intra- and extra-cellular fluid distribution (bioimpedance) and joint range of motion (goniometry). The mean tonometric measurements from the left, right, and dominant posterior thighs were significantly larger in participants with LF compared to participants who had tested negative for LF (p = 0.005, p = 0.004, and p = 0.003, respectively) indicating increased tissue compressibility in those adolescents with LF. ROC curve analysis to define optimal cut-off of the tonometry measurements indicated that at 3.5, sensitivity of this potential screening test is 100% (95%-CI = 86.3%, 100%) and specificity is 21.4% (95%-CI = 8.3%, 41.0%). It is proposed that this cut-off can be used to indicate tissue change characteristic of LF in an at-risk population of PNG adolescents. Further longitudinal research is required to establish if all those with tissue change subsequently develop lymphedema.

The former is quick and easy to do on large numbers of insects but provides no information on the frequency distribution of infection, presence of early developmental stages, or larval location; the latter is labor-intensive and tedious. We describe a new technique that can provide data comparable to those obtained by individual dissection, including calculation of infection and infective rates, and this technique is easy enough to accommodate large numbers of insects. Brief treatment of ethanol-fixed, intact mosquitoes in sodium hypochlorite, followed by treatments in increasing concentrations of ethanol and an organic solvent allowed microscopic visualization of filarial larvae within the abdomen, thorax, head, and proboscis of Brugia malayi-infected Aedes aegypti and Wuchereria bancrofti-infected Anopheles punctulatus. We compared the classic techniques to our technique using Ae. aegypti infected by feeding on jirds with B. malayi microfilaremias.

The theoretical analysis examines the relationship between microfilarial burdens and the prevalence of adult (macrofilarial) worms in the human host population. The main finding is that a large proportion of observed mf-negatives may be 'true' zeros, arising from the absence of macrofilarial infections or unmated adult worms, rather than being attributable to the blood sampling process. The corresponding mf distribution should then follow a Poisson mixture, arising from the sampling of mf positives, with an additional proportion of 'true' mf-zeros. This hypothesis is supported by analysis of observed Wuchereria bancrofti mf distributions from Southern India, Japan and Fiji, in which zero-truncated Poisson mixtures fit mf-positive counts more effectively than distributions including the observed zeros. The fits of two Poisson mixtures, the negative binomial and the Sichel distribution, are compared. The Sichel provides a slightly better empirical description of the mf density distribution; reasons for this improvement, and a discussion of the relative merits of the two distributions, are presented. The impact on observed mf distributions of increasing blood sampling volume and extraction efficiency are illustrated via a simple model, and directions for future work are identified.",1990,"Grenfell, B.T, Das, P.K., Rajagopalan, P.K., Bundy, D.A.P.",Parasitology,,101,417-427,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182000060613,Fiji,672,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,English,,PacELF_672 Grenfell et al 1990 PARASITOLOGY Frequency distribution of LF Mf in human populations S0031182000060613.pdf

Traps were baited with BG-Lure (a combination of lactic acid, ammonia, and caproic acid) or carbon dioxide plus octenol (1-octen-3-ol) known as attractants to aedine mosquitoes. Mosquito sampling was conducted on two typical islands of French Polynesia: the high, volcanic island of Moorea, and the low, coral island (atoll) of Tetiaroa. Sampling efficacy was measured in a randomized Latin Square design. Production of carbon dioxide from yeast-sugar fermentation was used as an alternative source of CO2 because supply via dry ice, gas cylinders, or propane combustion in remote tropical islands is costly and challenging. Although the BGS trap captured the greatest number of Ae. polynesiensis in both island settings, catch rates of BGS or BGM baited with either lure were not significantly different from that of HBC. On Moorea, the number of collected aedes species in the BGS trap baited with either lure was significantly greater than the BGM with BG-lure. On Tetiaroa, BGM trapping was severely hampered by damage from rats, and the traps were removed from the study.

The persistence of transmission may be partly related to the highly efficient Aedes vectors. The assessment of pathogen transmission by mosquito vectors and of vector control relies on the ability to capture mosquitoes efficiently. The aims of this study are to compare trapping methods to capture LF-infected mosquitoes and determine the role in transmission of the species of Aedes mosquitoes in the area. METHODS: Fasitoo-Tai village was the chosen site because of persistent transmission despite annual mass drug administration. Sampling methods included BioGents Sentinel (BGS) trap, human-baited collections (HBC) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) trap. BGS and CDC traps were baited with BG-lure, CO2, and/or octenol. Individual trap locations were geo-located and efficiency of sampling methods was evaluated using a randomized Latin-square design in two locations. Number of mosquitoes collected (male and female), as well as species for each trapping method were determined. Additionally, Ae. polynesiensis and Ae. (Finlaya) spp. females were pooled by trap method and analysed for filarial DNA. Infection prevalence was estimated using the PoolScreen software. RESULTS: The BGS trap with any type of bait collected more mosquitoes compared to both the CDC trap and the HBC. The BGS trap baited with BG-lure collected more mosquitoes than with CO2 and octenol. There were no significant differences between trapping methods in terms of proportions of infected females collected. The prevalence of filarial infection in Ae. polynesiensis and Ae. (Finlaya) spp. was estimated at 4.7% and 0.67% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of the BGS trap for research on and surveillance of the mosquito vectors of LF in Samoa. The BGS trap is a suitable and safer alternative to HBC for sampling Ae. polynesiensis and Ae. (Finlaya) spp., which continue to be the predominant vectors of LF.

Important values that were calculated are the duration of patency for single infections (2(1/2) years), the maximum density of microfilariae achieved by 1 female (70/60 mm(3) of peripheral blood), the average output of larvae by a female during her lifetime (1.32x10(7)), the death rate of mated females (0.02-0.05 per month), the average load of reproducing female worms per blood-positive person (6.91 for men, 6.07 for women, 2.93 for children), and the average total load of worms in infected people (11.18 for men, 7.70 for women, 4.02 for children).The implications of the approach taken are important from the standpoints of epidemiology and control.

LF was endemic in Solomon Islands but in the 2010-2020 Strategic Plan of the Global Programme to Eliminate LF, Solomon Islands was listed as non-endemic for LF. In countries now declared free of LF an important question is what monitoring strategy should be used to detect any residual foci of LF? METHODS: The index case, a 44 year old male, presented to Atoifi Adventist Hospital, Malaita, Solomon Islands in April 2011 with elephantiasis of the lower leg. Persistent swelling had commenced 16 months previously. He was negative for antigen by TropBio Og4C3 ELISA and for microfilaria. A week later a survey of 197 people aged from 1 year to 68 years was conducted at Alasi, the index case's village, by a research team from Atoifi Adventist Hospital and Atoifi College of Nursing. This represented 66.3% of the village population. Blood was collected between 22:00 and 03:00 by finger-prick and made into thick smears to detect microfilaria and collected onto filter paper for W. bancrofti antigen tests. A second group of 110 specimens was similarly collected from residents of the Hospital campus and inpatients. W. bancrofti antigen was tested for using the Trop-Bio Og4C3 test. RESULTS: One sample (1/307) from an 18 year old male from Alsai was positive for W. bancrofti antigen. No samples were positive for microfilaria. Although antigen-positivity indicated a live worm, the case was regarded as having been acquired some years previously. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that when LF has been eliminated from a country, a case of elephantiasis should be a trigger to conduct a survey of the case's community using a decision pathway.

Blood samples from 593 people revealed an overall microfilarial carrier rate of 24%. Amongst endemic villages, microfilarial carrier rates ranged from 5% to 43% and there was no significant difference in parasite prevalence between males and females. Obstructive filarial disease, defined as lymphoedema of the limbs or hydrocele, was observed in only 2% of 262 males examined. None of the 265 females examined had clinical symptoms. Entomological surveys yielded a total of 4095 mosquitoes including 3,692 anophelines and 241 culicines but only Anopheles farauti was found to harbour infective larvae of W. bancrofti. Pretreatment infection and infective rates of An. farauti were 7% and 1% respectively and up to 12 infective larvae were found in a single specimen. The microfilarial carrier rate in a cohort of people who received two DEC treatments dropped from 59% to 32% but the difference was not statistically significant. However, density of microfilaraemia decreased significantly from 170 to 10 mf/ml.

The most frequently collected anopheline in the matched indoor and light trap samples was Anopheles koliensis Owen, followed by A. punctulatus Donitz, A. karwari (James), A. farauti Laveran (sensu lato), A. longirostris Brug and A. bancroftii Giles. All species were much less frequent in the light traps than in landing catches. The hypothesis that the numbers of mosquitoes in light traps are proportional to human landing catches was examined using regression models that allowed for sampling error in both entomological measurements. Light traps under-sampled A. punctulatus and A. farauti s.l. at high densities. The models indicated that the ratio of light trap to landing catch females of A. koliensis and A. karwari increased with increasing mosquito density. Light trap catches of A. longirostris were proportional to indoor landing rates but when outdoor landing rates were high this species was under-sampled by light traps. Numbers of A. bancroftii in light traps were found to be proportional to those in outdoor landing catches, but were negatively related to those attempting to bite indoors. Circumsporozoite positivity rates for both Plasmodium falciparum Welch and P. vivax (Grassi & Feletti) in A. punctulatus and A. farauti s.l. were significantly higher in light trap collections than in either indoor or outdoor landing catches, suggesting that light traps may selectively sample older mosquitoes of these species.",2000,"Hii, J.L.K., Smith, T., Mai, A., Ibam, E., Alpers, M.P.",Bulletin of Entomological Research,,90(3),211-219,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000748530000033X,Papua New Guinea,695,Contact PacELF at JCU,Malaria,,English,,PacELF_695 Hii et al 2000 Comparison between anopheline mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) caught using different methods in a malaria endemic area of PNG.pdf

The total data set comprises 90,635 subject exposures and includes individuals of all ages and both genders. Results are presented for hospital-based studies, laboratory studies, active surveillance of microfilaria-positive and microfilaria-negative individuals, and passive monitoring in both community-based studies and mass treatment programmes of individuals treated with albendazole (n = 1538), ivermectin (9822), DEC (576), albendazole + ivermectin (7470), albendazole + DEC (69,020), or placebo (1144). The most rigorous monitoring, which includes haematological and biochemical laboratory parameters pre- and post-treatment, provides no evidence that consistent changes are induced by any treatment; the majority of abnormalities appear to be sporadic, and the addition of albendazole to either ivermectin or DEC does not increase the frequency of abnormalities. Both DEC and ivermectin show, as expected, an adverse event profile compatible with the destruction of microfilariae. The addition of albendazole to either single-drug treatment regimen does not appear to increase the frequency or intensity of events seen with these microfilaricidal drugs when used alone. Direct observations indicated that the level of adverse events, both frequency and intensity, was correlated with the level of microfilaraemia. In non microfilaraemic individuals, who form 80-90% of the 'at risk' populations to be treated in most national public health programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF), the event profile with the compounds alone or in combination does not differ significantly from that of placebo. Data on the use of ivermectin + albendazole in areas either of double infection (onchocerciasis and LF), or of loiais (with or without concurrent LF) are still inadequate and further studies are needed.

The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis aims to eliminate LF as a public health problem by the year 2020, primarily through repeated Mass Drug Administration (MDA). The Pacific region programme commenced in 1999. By June 2007, five of the eleven countries classified as endemic had completed five MDA campaigns and post-MDA prevalence surveys to assess their progress. We review available programme data and discuss their implications for other LF elimination programs in developing countries. METHODS: Reported MDA coverage and results from initial surveys and post-MDA surveys of LF using the immunochromatographic test (ICT) from these five Pacific Island countries (Tonga, Niue, Vanuatu, Samoa and Cook Islands) were analysed to provide an understanding of their quality and programme progress towards LF elimination. Denominator data reported by each country programme for 2001 was compared to official sources to assess the accuracy of MDA coverage data. RESULTS: Initial survey results from these five countries revealed an ICT prevalence of between 2.7 and 8.6 percent in individuals tested prior to commencement of the programme. Country MDA coverage results varied depending on the source of denominator data. Of the five countries in this case study, three countries (Tonga, Niue and Vanuatu) reached the target prevalence of <1% antigenaemia following five rounds of MDA. However, endpoint data could not be reliably compared to baseline data as survey methodology varied. CONCLUSION: Accurate and representative baseline and post-campaign prevalence data is crucial for determining program effectiveness and the factors contributing to effectiveness. This is emphasised by the findings of this case study. While three of the five Pacific countries reported achieving the target prevalence of <1% antigenaemia, limitations in the data preclude identification of key determinants of this achievement.",2009,"Huppatz, C., Capuano, C., Palmer, K., Kelly, P.M., Durrheim, D.N.",BMC Infectious Diseases,,9,92,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-9-92,Multicountry Pacific,708,Open  ,"MDA, ICT",,English,,PacELF_708 Huppatz et al 2009 BMC Inf Dis LF lessons from Pacific.pdf

712,JCU,409,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis: The processes underlying programme success,"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is caused by filarial worms that live in the lymphatic system and commonly lead to lymphoedema, elephantiasis, and hydrocele. LF is recognized as endemic in 73 countries and territories; an estimated 1.39 billion (thousand million) people live in areas where filariasis has been endemic and is now targeted for treatment [1]. Global momentum to eliminate LF has developed over the past 15 years as a result not only of research demonstrating the value of single-dose treatment strategies and point-of-care diagnostic tools, but also of both the generous donations of medicines from the following committed pharmaceutical companies: GlaxoSmithKline (albendazole), Merck (ivermectin), and Eisai (diethylcarbamazine; DEC), and the essential financial support for programme implementation from the donor community [2]. During 2011, more than 50 countries carried out LF elimination programmes, and more than 500 million people received mass treatment [1]. A principal reason for the programme's dramatic expansion and success to date has been the galvanizing of efforts of all key partners around a common policy framework created and coordinated through the World Health Organization's Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF). This report, rather than highlighting the very considerable contributions of each individual partner or even chronicling most of the specific achievements of the GPELF, instead focuses on the details of the underlying processes themselves and their importance in determining programme success.",2014,"Ichimori, K., King, J.D., Engels, D., Yajima, A., Mikhailov, A., Lammie, P., Ottesen, E.A.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,,8(12),e3328,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003328,Multicountry Global,712,Open  ,LF activities,,English,,PacELF_712 Ichimori et al 2014 PLOS NTDs Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis The processes underlying programme success.pdf

This is challenging in areas where the day-biting Aedes polynesiensis is endemic, such as Samoa, since in previous studies no geographical clustering of infection has been demonstrated. Another challenge for this low prevalence phase is the choice of diagnostic assay as testing for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) or microfilariae (Mf) alone may not have adequate sensitivity. This could be solved by using the commercially available filariasis Cellabs enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA) to measure antibody. In the current study five Samoan villages were chosen based on previous epidemiological assessments to represent a range of infection prevalences. CFA, Mf, and antibody levels in children </= 10 years had been recorded and results linked to household of residence and/or primary school of attendance. To ascertain the location of exposure, two scenarios based on potential foci of transmission around communities and schools were explored. Both scenarios revealed significant spatial clusters of households with infected individuals and a relationship to antibody positive children when they were included in the spatial analysis. Fasitoo-Tai had the highest LF prevalence and largest geographical spatial clusters for both scenarios. In Falefa, spatial clusters were detected only for the primary school scenario. In Tafua, which spanned an area of 19.5 km(2), no spatial clusters were detected. Lastly, in Siufaga, the village with the lowest LF prevalence, significant clustering of infected individuals was observed and, for the primary school scenario, this was geographically related to exposure.

The epidemiologic features and natural history of Wuchereria bancrofti infection in this geographic region, however, have not been well-defined. The objective of this study was to assess the parasitological and clinical features of bancroftian filariasis in a community in East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea. In a village of 99 individuals, the overall prevalence of microfilaremia was 68%. The microfilarial carrier rate was high in those less than or equal to 10 years (62%), remained elevated in the 11-20, 21-30, and 31-40 age groups (42-55%), and peaked in subjects greater than or equal to 41 years old (90%). The geometric mean level of parasitemia in all subjects with patent infection was 3,198 microfilariae/ml blood. This value was 78 parasites/ml in the less than or equal to 10-year-old age group, increased to 1,753 in 21 to 30-year-olds and was markedly elevated in subjects greater than or equal to 41 years old (6, 792 microfilariae/ml). Acute symptoms of filariasis (lymphadenitis and lymphangitis) were initially noted in individuals between the ages of 11 and 20 years (30%). Obstructive disease, manifested as elephantiasis and hydroceles, was present in 64 and 79% of 31-40 and greater than or equal to 41-year-olds, respectively. These data suggest that intense transmission of W. bancrofti infection occurs at an early age in this area of East Sepik Province; patent infection remains high in older age groups.

The purpose of this paper is to present the evidence base for decision-makers on the cost and cost-effectiveness of lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis prevention, treatment, and control. A systematic review of the published literature was conducted. All studies that contained primary or secondary data on costs or cost-effectiveness of prevention and control were considered. A total of 52 papers were included for LF and 24 papers were included for onchocerciasis. Large research gaps exist on the synergies and cost of integrating NTD prevention and control programs, as well as research on the role of health information systems, human resource systems, service delivery, and essential medicines and technology for elimination. The literature available on costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions is also generally older, extremely focal geographically and of limited usefulness for developing estimates of the global economic burden of these diseases and prioritizing among various intervention options. Up to date information on the costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions for LF and onchocerciasis prevention are needed given the vastly expanded funding base for the control and elimination of these diseases.

A mass treatment programme with diethylcarbamazine was then decided on.Preliminary treatment with a single total regimen of 72 mg of the drug per kg of body weight, given in 12 doses of 6 mg/kg, was administered in several villages over a period of 6 months. Among villagers of all ages at the end of 3 years, the microfilarial rate was 7.3% and the MfD(50) value was 2. These results appeared to be inadequate for a successful control programme and a periodic mass treatment project of 2 or more regimens of 72 mg/kg to be administered every 2 years was instituted on the Island of Tutuila, to be continued until considered no longer necessary.Surveys made 2 years after the second mass treatment in the villages of Amouli, Amanave, Onenoa, Tula, Alao, Utumea and Alofau, in which 1407 persons were examined, showed that 3 villages were negative for microfilariae, that the average microfilarial rate in all 7 villages was 0.4% and that the MfD(50) was 1. These villages were also negative in intensive mosquito surveys for infective-stage larvae of Wuchereria bancrofti. It is suggested that interruption of transmission has been observed in the 3 villages negative for both microfilariae and infective-stage larvae and that, if favourable surveys continue, eradication programmes should be established.",1970,"Kessel, J.F., Siliga, N., Tompkins Jr., H., Jones, K.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,,43(6),817-825,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2427816/,American Samoa,743,Open  ,,,English,,PacELF_743 Kessel et al 1970 LF MDA in American Samoa bullwho00210-0048.pdf
744,JCU,441,JCU WHOCC,,Electronic/Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,The global Programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis: History and achievements with special reference to annual single-dose treatment with diethylcarbamazine in Samoa and Fiji,"Diethylcarbamazine (DEC), first introduced in 1947, was shown to have strong efficacy and safety for treatment of human lymphatic filariasis, which is caused mostly by a species Wuchereria bancrofti. Many studies to optimize the dosage and treatment schedule of DEC followed, and, based on the results, control programs with various regimens were implemented in different endemic areas/countries. By the mid 1970s, with endorsement by the WHO Expert Committee on Filariasis (3rd report, 1974), the standard DEC regimen for W. bancrofti infection in mass treatment had been established in principle: a total dose of 72 mg/kg of body weight given in 12 divided doses, once weekly or monthly, at 6 mg/kg each. Not long after the committee report, the efficacy of annual single-dose treatment at 6 mg/kg, which is only one twelfth of the WHO-recommended dose in a year, was reported effective in French Polynesia (study period: 1973-78), and later in Samoa (study period: 1979-81). These results were published between 1978 and 1985 in the Bulletin of WHO but received little attention. In the mid 1980s, the efficacy of ivermectin, the first-choice drug for onchocerciasis, against lymphatic filariae came to light. Since the effect at a single dose was remarkable, and often better than DEC, it was predicted that the newly introduced drug would replace DEC. Treatment experiments with ivermectin increased quickly in number. Meanwhile, annual single-dose mass drug administration (MDA) with DEC at 6 mg/kg was under scrutiny in Samoa and Fiji. In the early 1990s, the Samoan study, which covered the entire population of 160,000 with 3 annual MDAs, reported a significant reduction in microfilaria (mf) prevalence and mean mf density, while in Fiji, the efficacy of 5 rounds of annual MDA (total dose, 30 mg/kg) was shown to be as effective as 28 multi-dose MDA spread over 2 years (6 weekly plus 22 monthly treatments at 5 mg/kg; total dose, 140 mg/kg). Several additional studies carried out in Samoa in relation to the annual single-dose MDAs revealed that low density mf carriers, who have a very low mf count of 1-20/ml of venous blood, could not play a significant role in filariasis transmission.From around 1990, studies on spaced low-dose DEC treatments and various types of combination chemotherapy with DEC and ivermectin increased. Albendazole, a well-known anti-intestinal helminths agent, was later added to the combination. The main findings of these studies with W. bancrofti are: (i) a single dose of DEC at 6 mg/kg reduced mean mf density by ca. 90% 1 year after treatment; (ii) the same dose could damage/kill adult worms; (iii) a single dose of ivermectin at ca. 400 microg/kg was more effective than DEC in reducing mf density during the first year and was similarly or less effective in the second year; (iv) ivermectin probably could not kill adult worms; (v) a single combined dose of albendazole (400 mg) and DEC (6 mg/kg) was effective to reduce mf density by 85 to nearly 100% 12-24 months after treatment; and (vi) ivermectin or albendazole included in the combination chemotherapy produced ""beyond-filariasis"" benefits: clearance/reduction of intestinal helminths, and, additionally, in the case of ivermectin, skin-dwelling ectoparasites.The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) started its worldwide activities in 2000, with the target of elimination by 2020. The basic strategy is to conduct annual single-dose MDAs for 4-6 years. In 2000-2007, a minimum of 570 million individuals were treated in 48 of 83 endemic countries. The drugs used are DEC 6 mg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg in most countries, or ivermectin 200-400 microg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg particularly in onchocerciasis endemic countries in Africa. (MDAs with DEC alone had been used in India.)The GPELF achieved impressive results in terms of parasitological cure/improvement, clinical benefits, social and economic impacts, etc. However, the most impressive result of all was the programme's success in mobilizing hundreds of millions of local people, who not only took drugs but many of them actively supported MDAs as drug distributors and volunteers.

The low-density carriers were more numerous among those under 20 years and over 60 years old than in other age groups. The ratio of low-density carriers to the total of mf-positive subjects in a village decreased as the prevalence rate of Wuchereria bancrofti in the village increased.The epidemiological significance of low-density carriers was assessed in connection with the infectivity of vector mosquitos (Aedes polynesiensis) produced by them, the possible change of these carriers to carriers of a higher density, and the production of new low-density carriers by diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC-C) treatment. The mosquito infectivity produced by the low-density carriers accounted for only 2.16% of the total infectivity produced by all the carriers, suggesting that these carriers are of minor importance in the transmission of filariasis. The change of microfilarial count over time among untreated mf-positive subjects was not remarkable during a 60-252-day observation period. However, the low-density carrier group showed a mean increase of 36%, the younger such carriers (under 30 years old) showing a 132% increase.

In contrast, filarial Ag-driven IL-5 production was 5.5-fold greater (p < 0.001), and plasma IL-4 and TGF-beta levels were 4-fold and 34% higher, respectively, in residents of the high transmission village. IL-4 and IL-10 responses by PBMC differed little according to village, and increased production of the counterregulatory cytokines IL-10 or TGF-beta by PBMC did not correlate with weak proliferation and IFN-gamma responses.

L1 had a U-shaped growth in length, while widths followed an S-shaped function. L2 had an S-shaped growth in length and width. Growth in length of L3 was also S-shaped, while widths had an asymptotic size following a period of rapid shrinkage. The greatest difference between length and width was in stage 3 where the length was over 75 times greater than the width. The ratio of length to width was approximately 50 for microfilariae and only 10 for the L1 ('sausage') stage. Characteristic mean length (and width) were approximately 280(7) microm for microfilariae, approximately 181 microm for L1 at their smallest, and approximately 1584(22) microm for L3 infective larvae. There was a great increase in length during stage 2 from approximately 322(27) to approximately 982(31) microm. Stage duration decreased with increasing temperature while growth rate increased, giving steeper growth curves. There was no effect of temperature on size, except for L3, which were shorter when mosquitoes were reared at higher temperature. It appears that larval growth is a continuous process from microfilariae to the young L3 stage, and continuously modifies the larval parasite aspect, even within each stage. Thus, information on larval shape may be used as an age indicator and in some cases, may give an estimation on time elapsed since infection of the vector. An important demographic parameter used in most mathematical models describing transmission of parasites by insect vectors is the length of the gonotrophic cycle of the vector, i.e. the time interval between two successive blood-meals. Usual methods for computing such a parameter are based on mark-recapture techniques. However, reliable estimates need substantial capture rates, which are not always possible. This paper presents another approach in which marked mosquitoes are those naturally infected by W. bancrofti. For one mosquito, the time since infection is simply the age of the developing larval parasite. Our method first expresses the age of larval parasite as a fraction of total development time (from microfilariae entering the vector to L3 larvae) using a regression model based on measurements of the parasite's length and width. This fraction of development is then converted to a chronological age since infection, using a back-calculation procedure involving ambient temperatures and growth rates of W. bancrofti larvae in the vector. The method is applied to wild caught Ae. polynesiensis in French Polynesia to compute the length of the gonotrophic cycle. This mosquito species comes to bite approximately 3, 6-7 and 9 days after a first infectious blood-meal.

Among these, 106 (8.96%) were infected with W. bancrofti and 34 (2.87%) harbored infective L3 larvae. The mean number of larvae per infected mosquito was 2.69, and the mean number of L3 lavae per L3 positive mosquito was 1.44. The Ae. polynesiensis biting index was 4.7 bites per 15 min, but varied significantly among habitats. The highest parous biting rates occurred in fields and peridomestic gardens and the lowest was close to houses. The proportion of parous infected and infective mosquitoes was higher in peridomestic habitats (0.25 infective bites per 15 min) than in domestic habitats (0.09) or in fields (0.11).",1995,"Lardeux, F., Nguyen, N.L., Cartel, J.-L.",Journal of Medical Entomology,,32(3),346-352,,French Polynesia,785,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,English,,PacELF_785 Lardeux et al 1995 J MED ENT 02022016103106-0001.pdf

We examined the seroprevalence and spatial epidemiology of LF post-MDA to inform strategies for ongoing surveillance and to reduce resurgence risk. METHODS: ELISA for LF antigen (Og4C3) and antibodies (Wb123, Bm14) were performed on a geo-referenced serum bank of 807 adults collected in 2010. Risk factors assessed for association with sero-positivity included age, sex, years lived in American Samoa, and occupation. Geographic clustering of serological indicators was investigated to identify spatial dependence and household-level clustering. RESULTS: Og4C3 antigen of >128 units (positive) were found in 0.75% (95% CI 0.3-1.6%) of participants, and >32 units (equivocal plus positive) in 3.2% (95% CI 0.6-4.7%). Seroprevalence of Wb123 and Bm14 antibodies were 8.1% (95% CI 6.3-10.2%) and 17.9% (95% CI 15.3-20.7%) respectively. Antigen-positive individuals were identified in all ages, and antibody prevalence higher in older ages. Prevalence was higher in males, and inversely associated with years lived in American Samoa. Spatial distribution of individuals varied significantly with positive and equivocal levels of Og4C3 antigen, but not with antibodies. Using Og4C3 cutoff points of >128 units and >32 units, average cluster sizes were 1,242 m and 1,498 m, and geographical proximity of households explained 85% and 62% of the spatial variation respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High-risk populations for LF in American Samoa include adult males and recent migrants. We identified locations and estimated the size of possible residual foci of antigen-positive adults, demonstrating the value of spatial analysis in post-MDA surveillance. Strategies to monitor cluster residents and high-risk groups are needed to reduce resurgence risk.

With these statistics, failures of diethylcarbamazine treatment can be roughly divided into three groups: primary treatment failures, manifested by persistent microfilaraemia; secondary treatment failures, manifested by microfilaraemia recurring within the prepatent period after apparently successful treatment; and new infections. When cases of persistent and recurrent microfilaraemia are excluded by appropriate statistical manipulations, the incidence of new infections is seen to be many times higher in persons who originally showed microfilaraemia. This suggests that susceptibility or exposure, or both, are not homogeneously distributed in the population, and indicates that proposed mathematical models of filarial epidemiology must be further refined.

Important biological and epidemiological aspects are also described including the lifecycle of each parasite species and their specificities, the geographical biodiversity of each pathogen and their vectors where the parasites are co-endemic, and biological, environmental and climatic determinants influencing transmission. The co-transmission of each disease is illustrated from both a global perspective and a country level using Thailand as a study case. Different diagnostic methods are provided for the detection of the parasites in biological samples ranging from traditional to more recent molecular methods, including methodologies employing concomitant detection assays of W. bancrofti and Plasmodium spp. parasites.

Filariasis in northern Fiji: epidemiological evidence regarding the mechanisms of pathogenesis.,"During a filariasis survey conducted in northern Fiji in 1968—9 examinations were made for microfilaraemia, enlarged lymph nodes and elephantiasis. Analysis of the microfilarial densities at different ages and the number of anatomical sites showing lymph gland enlargement or elephantiasis have been used to provide evidence on the clustering of infections and pathogenesis. Although there is no evidence of clustering of risk of infection, there is evidence favouring the clustering of adult filariae in individuals. Nevertheless the number of sites of lymph node enlargement do not correspond with this finding and statistical evidence suggests that lymph-node enlargement is not necessarily associated with the near presence in the body of adult filariae, whether dead or alive. Males of Indian ethnic origin showed a higher prevalence of elephantiasis than males of Fijian ethnic origin, but women of either ethnic race showed prevalences lower than those of men. The onset of elephantiasis at a site does not directly reflect the number of infections sustained in the local area, but it appears that filariasis first induces for a limited period a proneness to elephantiasis. During this period a random and discrete event may induce the onset of elephantiasis. The nature of the event is unknown, but it probably is not trauma.",1971,"Mataika, J.U., Dando, B.C., Spears, G.F.S., Macnamara, F.N.",Journal of Hygiene,,69(2),297-306,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022172400021525,Fiji,806,Open via Publisher,,,English,,PacELF_806 Mataika et al 1971 J HYG Mosquito-borne infections in Fiji III.pdf

The so-called ""non-periodic"" Pacific form of Wuchereria bancrofti in fact shows a well-marked and relatively constant periodicity. The amplitude of this periodicity is low, which may account for the difficulty of detecting it in small clinical samples. The periodicity is well adapted to the biting cycle of Aedes polynesiensis, though less so than that of the ""semi-periodic"" Brugia malayi to forest Mansonioides. Microfilarial periodicity is discussed in the light of recent work on circadian rhythms in other animals and it is suggested that certain possibilities have been given insufficient weight. The use of the term ""migration"" to describe microfilarial translocation within the host may have given rise to misunderstanding but it is in good agreement with current concepts of migration. Recent work suggests some behavioural heterogeneity in Culex fatigans which could render it a useful mosquito for elucidating certain important but little-understood problems.",1962,"Mattingly, P.F.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,,27(4-5),569-578,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2555875/,Multicountry Global,809,Open  ,,,English,,PacELF_809 Mattingly 1962 BULL WHO Culex and LF bullwho00309-0147.pdf

(3) The microfilarial density expressed as the average count per positive case for each age-group can provide useful information regarding the intensity of transmission, and can be used to demonstrate changes of filarial endemicity which may be occurring in any given locality. (4) The average age-group densities, considered in relation to the incidence of major physical signs of filarial disease, suggest that the development of these major signs requires a certain minimum parasite load to be maintained for some few years.In Western Samoa it is suggested that the minimum parasite load is that equivalent to an average age-group count of 60 microfilariae per 20 c.mm. blood, and that if this be maintained hydrocele will appear in the male population approximately 5 years later, and that elephantiasis will first appear approximately 10 years later.",1956,"McCarthy, D.D., Fitzgerald, N.",Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,50(1),58-65,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0035-9203(56)90009-8,Samoa,812,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,English,,PacELF_812 McCarthy and Fitzgerald 1956 TRSTMH LF in W Samoa.pdf

Here, we use a combined modelling and comparative data analysis framework to address this issue for human infections with the filarial parasite, Wuchereria bancrofti. By analogy with previous work, the analysis involves the comparison of observed field patterns of infection with epidemiological patterns predicted by a mathematical model of parasite immunity. Unlike most other human helminths, which are transmitted by ingestion or dermal penetration, exposure to infection with lymphatic filariasis can be measured explicitly in terms of vector mosquito biting rates, thereby also allowing, probably for the first time, examination of the suggested role of exposure in generating herd immunity to macroparasites. Observed field patterns in this study were derived from 19 different published studies, which gave parallel estimates of community exposure rates and the corresponding age--prevalence patterns of infection, while predictions of the epidemiological impact of herd immunity were obtained using a catalytic model framework. The results provide the first conclusive evidence to date that variations in the observed age--prevalence patterns of infection in filariasis can be effectively explained by the occurrence of an exposure-driven acquisition of herd immunity.

A method for aggregating and projecting prevalence data from individual studies to national, regional and global levels, which also facilitates the estimation of gender and age-specific burdens, is presented. The method weights in favour of the larger, and hence presumbably more reliable, studies and relies on estimated empirical relationships between gender, age, infection and disease in order to correct studies with incomplete data. The results presented here suggest that although the overall prevalence of filariasis cases is 2.0% globally (approximately totalling 119 million cases), the disease continues to be of considerable local importance, particularly in India and Sub-Saharan Africa. Estimates by age and gender clearly show that, unlike other helminth infections, filariasis is mainly a disease of the adult and older age-classes and appears to be more prevalent in males. This work suggests that the derivation of more accurate estimates of the burden of filariasis will require a better understanding of both the epidemiology and the spatial aspects of infection and disease.

The costs of eradication, managerial impediments to executing national control programmes, and scientific uncertainty about transmission endpoints, are challenges to the success of this effort, especially in areas of high endemicity where financial resources are limited. We used a combined analysis of empirical community data describing the association between infection and chronic disease prevalence, mathematical modelling, and economic analyses to identify and evaluate the feasibility of setting an infection target level at which the chronic pathology attributable to lymphatic filariasis - lymphoedema of the extremities and hydroceles - becomes negligible in the face of continuing transmission as a first stage option in achieving the elimination of this parasitic disease. The results show that microfilaria prevalences below a threshold of 3.55% at a blood sampling volume of 1 ml could constitute readily achievable and sustainable targets to control lymphatic filarial disease. They also show that as a result of the high marginal cost of curing the last few individuals to achieve elimination, maximal benefits can occur at this threshold.

Here we review recent work on the development and application of a deterministic mathematical model of filariasis transmission, to show how models of parasite transmission will help resolve the key currently debated questions regarding the ultimate effectiveness of the global strategy to control filariasis. These critical questions include the required duration of mass treatment in different endemic areas, the optimal drug coverage required to meet control targets within prescribed timeframes, the impact and importance of adding vector control to mass chemotherapy regimens, and the likelihood of the development of drug resistance by treated worm populations. The results demonstrate the vital role that integrating these models into control programming can have in providing effective decision-support frameworks for undertaking the optimal design and monitoring of regional and global filariasis-control programmes.

Despite the occurrence of a number of studies investigating mosquito survival after infection with filarial worms, there remains conflicting evidence from both laboratory and field experiments as to the existence and mechanism for parasite-induced mortality among filarial mosquitoes. Here, we used a mixed effects meta-analytical framework to combine the data from all available vector-human host blood feeding experiments to evaluate the evidence for the impact of parasite load on the mortality rates of the three major lymphatic filariasis transmitting mosquito genera, Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquitoes, over the extrinsic incubation period of parasitic infection. The results show that, despite the application of this approach, or in the case of Anopheles using a convention fixed effects logistic regression analysis supplemented with additional survival analysis of longitudinal data, no strong association between mortality rate and microfilariae (mf) uptake for either of the three mosquito genera is apparent in the combined data. Instead, a key finding is that study effects played a more crucial role in determining the levels of mortality observed in these experimental studies. This was most revealing in the case of Culex, given that the largest single study in terms of both the number of data points and range of mf intensities, in contrast to smaller studies, showed a significant positive association between mf intensity and mortality, indicating that in this genus at least, the detrimental effect of infection may be manifested only at the highest mf intakes. Although no density dependence in vector mortality was also observed for Aedes, possibly because of the use of restricted human mf intensity range in previous studies, an intriguing finding was that a significantly higher overall mortality was observed for this genus over mfintake ranges that produced much less corresponding mortality in Culex and Anopheles. The results also indicate that currently very little can be said about the survival rate of Anopheles mosquitoes infected with filarial worms because of the striking paucity of data for this genus.

Some experts, however, consider that longer periods of treatment might be necessary in certain high prevalence and transmission environments based upon past unsuccessful field experience and modelling. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To evaluate predictors of success in a LF control program we conducted an ecological study during a pre-existing MDA program. We studied 27 villages in Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, from two areas with different infection rates before MDA. We undertook surveys to collect information on variables potentially having an influence on the outcome of the program, including epidemiological (baseline prevalence of infection, immigration rate), entomological (vector density) and operational (treatment coverage, vector control strategies) variables. The success in a village was defined using variables related to the infection (circulating filarial antigenemia prevalence < 1%) and transmission (antigenemia prevalence < 1 in 1000 children born since start of MDA). 8709 people were involved in the MDA program and average coverage rates were around 70%. The overall prevalence of filariasis fell from an initial 17.91% to 3.76% at round 5 (p < 0.001). Viewed on a village by village basis, 12/27 (44%) villages achieved success. In multivariate analysis, low baseline prevalence was the only factor predicting both success in reducing infection rates (OR 19,26; CI 95% 1,12 to 331,82) and success in preventing new infections (OR 27,44; CI 95% 1,05 to 719,6). Low vector density and the use of an optimal vector control strategy were also associated with success in reducing infection rates, but this did not reach statistical significance.

Diagnosis has been revolutionized with the availability of circulating filarial antigen (CFA) tests which are easy to perform but are costly. Filariasis is responsible for acquired eosinophilia and eosinophil blood count (EBC) is commonly used as a screening tool. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed all the results of EBCs and CFA tests performed in our laboratory over a 2-year period. We calculated the prevalence of antigenemia for nine different eosinophil cutoffs. We calculated the number of patients detected by CFA testing and the number of estimated CFA-positive patients according to their EBC. RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, we detected 7503 eosinophilic patients. For an EBC above 500/mm(3), the prevalence of positive CFA was 25.78% and the estimated number of positive CFA patients was 1934. During the same period, as CFA determination is not routinely performed, only 141 patients were detected and treated. CONCLUSION: Our current strategy against lymphatic filariasis which combines annual mass drug administration, systematic treatment of antigenemic and microfilaraemic patients, and vector control; failed to reach the target of 1% prevalence.

In endemic areas, most infected individuals are asymptomatic but may harbor microfilariae or filarial antigens in their peripheral blood. Microscopy remains the reference diagnostic tool for the identification of microfilariae but is weakly sensitive. The diagnosis of Wuchereria bancrofti infection was dramatically altered by the development of filarial antigen tests, which are easy to perform but expensive for routine use. Lymphatic filariasis is responsible for acquired eosinophilia and blood eosinophil count is commonly used as a screening tool in endemic areas. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed all the results of eosinophil counts, antigen and microfilariae detection performed in our laboratory over a 24-month period.

Despite rapid progress in scaling up the program to more than 38 endemic countries (or perhaps even because of this rapid progress), there is one element essential for ultimate program success that is now being severely neglected-research, both operational and basic (upstream) ... It was toward this end that efforts were made during 2003−2004 to gather diverse and valued input from a very broad representation of the filariasis community, both program and research oriented. More than 90 research, clinical, and public health experts in LF came together in meetings (Annexes 1−3) and deliberations for the purpose of creating a comprehensive, collective assessment of today’s LF research horizon and research needs. While there was broad agreement that the GPELF remains very much on target, in-depth assessments were made of ways to improve program support or increase understanding for each of the most important issues related to operational and basic, upstream research.

In order to standardize our PCR method and refine our protocol to assess filarial infection levels in mosquitoes, we compared dissection of the vector, Aedes polynesiensis, with the poolscreening polymerase chain reaction (PS-PCR) assay. METHODS: (1) Mosquitoes were collected in human landing catches in five areas in Moorea island, French Polynesia. (2) A fraction of the captured mosquitoes was dissected for Wuchereria bancrofti larvae. (3) Laboratory-reared mosquitoes (uninfected as well as experimentally infected ones) were repeatedly tested to optimize a PS-PCR protocol (DNA extracts from 1-50 pooled mosquitoes were tested with an internal standardized system and primers specific for the Ssp1 repeat sequence. PCR products were analysed by gel electrophoresis). (4) Another fraction of the captured mosquitoes was assayed by PS-PCR according the optimized protocol. RESULTS: The prevalence of field-mosquito infection with W. bancrofti ranged from 1 to 8 % by dissection (L1-L3) and point estimates of infection prevalence, as assayed by PS-PCR, ranged from 0.4 to 3.7 %. There was a moderately strong correlation between larval infection rates as determined by dissection and PCR. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the PS-PCR assay is specific and highly sensitive for detecting parasite DNA. We obtained similar although not identical results with dissections of mosquitoes. PS-PCR appears to be adequate for testing large numbers of mosquitoes in the context of filariasis elimination programs.

Results six months after the intervention indicate that the program was successful in reducing microfilaraemia at Fogomaiyu village from 92% to 6%.

908,JCU,605,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the filarial nematode Wuchereria bancrofti from three geographic isolates provides evidence of complex demographic history,"Mitochondrial (mt) genome sequences have enabled comparison of population genetics and evolution for numerous free-living and parasitic nematodes. Here we define the complete mt genome of Wuchereria bancrofti through analysis of isolates from Papua New Guinea, India and West Africa. Sequences were assembled for each isolate and annotated with reference to the mt genome sequence for Brugia malayi. The length of the W. bancrofti mt genome is approximately 13,637 nucleotides, contains 2 ribosomal RNAs (rrns), 22 transfer RNAs (trns), 12 protein-coding genes, and is characterized by a 74.6% AT content. The W. bancrofti mt gene order is identical to that reported for Onchocerca volvulus, Dirofilaria immitis, Setaria digitata and B. malayi. In addition to using translational start codons identified previously in the mt protein-coding genes of other filarial nematodes, W. bancrofti appears to be unique in using TGT as a translational start codon. Similarly, use of incomplete stop codons in mt protein-coding genes appears to be more common in W. bancrofti than in other human filarial parasites. The complete mt genome sequence reported here provides new genetic markers for investigating phylogenetic and geographic relationships between isolates, and assessing population diversity within endemic regions. The sequence polymorphism enables new strategies to monitor the progress of public health interventions to control and eliminate this important human parasite. We illustrate the utility of this sequence and single nucleotide polymorphisms by inferring the divergence times between the three W. bancrofti isolates, suggesting predictions into their origin and migration.",2012,"Ramesh, A., Small, S.T., Kloos, Z.A., Kazura, J.W., Nutman, T.B., Serre, D., Zimmerman, P.A.",Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology,,183(1),32-41,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2012.01.004,Papua New Guinea,908,Open via Publisher,,,English,,PacELF_908 Ramesh et al 2012 MOL BIOCHEM PARASITOL 1-s2.0-S0166685112000229-main.pdf

An assay based on detection of the W. bancrofti ""LDR"" repeat DNA sequence was more sensitive than an assay for Wolbachia 16S rDNA. The LDR-based assay was sensitive for detecting microfilarial DNA on dried membrane filters or on filter paper. We also compared real-time PCR with conventional PCR (C-PCR) for detecting W. bancrofti DNA in mosquito samples collected in endemic areas in Egypt and Papua New Guinea. Although the two methods had comparable sensitivity for detecting filarial DNA in reference samples, real-time PCR was more sensitive than C-PCR in practice with field samples. Other advantages of real-time PCR include its high-throughput capacity and decreased risk of cross-contamination between test samples.

We optimized the assays with purified DNA samples and then used these assays to test DNA samples isolated from Anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes collected in villages in Papua New Guinea where these infections are co-endemic. Singleplex assays detected Wb, Pf and Pv DNA in 32%, 19% and 15% of the mosquito pools, respectively, either alone or together with other parasites. Multiplex assay results agreed with singleplex results in most cases. Overall parasite DNA rates in mosquitoes, estimated by PoolScreen 2 software, for Wb, Pf and Pv were 4.9%, 2.7% and 2.1%, respectively. Parasite DNA rates were consistently higher in blood-fed mosquitoes than in host-seeking mosquitoes. Our results show that multiplex qPCR can be used to detect and estimate prevalence rates for multiple parasite species in arthropod vectors. We believe that multiplex molecular xenodiagnosis has great potential as a tool for non-invasively assessing the distribution and prevalence of vector-borne pathogens such as W bancrofti and Plasmodium spp. in human populations and for assessing the impact of interventions aimed at controlling or eliminating these diseases.

It is targeted for elimination by 2020, through preventive chemotherapy using albendazole in combination with either ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine citrate. Preventive chemotherapy enables the regular and coordinated administration of safe, single-dose medications delivered through mass drug administration (MDA). Many countries are now scaling down MDA activities after achieving 100% geographic coverage and instituting monitoring and evaluation procedures to establish the impact of several consecutive rounds of MDA and determine if transmission has been interrupted. At the same time, countries yet to initiate MDA for elimination of LF will adopt improved mapping and coverage assessment protocols to accelerate the efforts for achieving global elimination by 2020.

917,JCU,614,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Insecticidal bed nets and filariasis transmission in Papua New Guinea,"BACKGROUND: Global efforts to eliminate lymphatic filariasis are based on the annual mass administration of antifilarial drugs to reduce the microfilaria reservoir available to the mosquito vector. Insecticide-treated bed nets are being widely used in areas in which filariasis and malaria are coendemic. METHODS: We studied five villages in which five annual mass administrations of antifilarial drugs, which were completed in 1998, reduced the transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti, one of the nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis. A total of 21,899 anopheles mosquitoes were collected for 26 months before and 11 to 36 months after bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticide were distributed in 2009. We evaluated the status of filarial infection and the presence of W. bancrofti DNA in anopheline mosquitoes before and after the introduction of insecticide-treated bed nets. We then used a model of population dynamics to estimate the probabilities of transmission cessation. RESULTS: Village-specific rates of bites from anopheline mosquitoes ranged from 6.4 to 61.3 bites per person per day before the bed-net distribution and from 1.1 to 9.4 bites for 11 months after distribution (P<0.001). During the same period, the rate of detection of W. bancrofti in anopheline mosquitoes decreased from 1.8% to 0.4% (P=0.005), and the rate of detection of filarial DNA decreased from 19.4% to 14.9% (P=0.13). The annual transmission potential was 5 to 325 infective larvae inoculated per person per year before the bed-net distribution and 0 after the distribution. Among all five villages with a prevalence of microfilariae of 2 to 38%, the probability of transmission cessation increased from less than 1.0% before the bed-net distribution to a range of 4.9 to 95% in the 11 months after distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Vector control with insecticide-treated bed nets is a valuable tool for W. bancrofti elimination in areas in which anopheline mosquitoes transmit the parasite.

The former mosquito is the principal vector of nonperiodic filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and the latter is a closely related species refractory to the development of human filariae. The practicability of such competitive displacement was studied by a field trial on a remote coral atoll where there was an established population of A. polynesiensis. Three strains of Al albopictus were liberated at separate localities on the atoll and their fate was followed for 4 years. One strain disappeared within 12 months after release and the other two disappeared within 48 months.

Their surveillance is hindered by a relative lack of attraction to light traps, necessitating the undesirable use of human bait collections with the inherent risks of pathogen transmission. The effectiveness of CDC- and EVS-type light traps baited with olfactory attractants was evaluated for these two Aedes species and the nocturnal Culex (Culex) quinquefasciatus Say in three sites in urban and semi-rural environments on Moorea in October/November 2003. Firstly, four CDC-type traps with light only, light with octenol, light with carbon dioxide (dry ice), and light with octenol plus carbon dioxide were operated continuously over four days with daily rotation to compensate for position effects. Secondly, two CDC- and two EVS-type traps with carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide plus octenol were operated continuously over four days with similar rotation. Variation was found in the numbers of the three species collected at the different sites, reflecting the relative availability of their preferred larval habitats. With the CDC traps in the first trial, the addition of octenol to the light did not significantly increase the collection of any species, the addition of carbon dioxide did significantly increase collection of all three species, while the addition of octenol to the light plus carbon dioxide did not significantly increase the collections further. In the second trial, there was no significant difference in the mean number of Ae. aegypti or Ae. polynesiensis collected in either EVS or CDC traps when baited with carbon dioxide or with octenol added. For Cx. quinquefasciatus, the supplementation with octenol made no significant difference with EVS traps but resulted in significantly reduced collections in CDC traps. Overall, neither trap, however baited, provided large samples when compared with landing/ biting collections at human bait.

Biting rates of both species tended to increase (but not always significantly) for each species in each region each month from the late dry season to the late wet season, and the north coast region had significantly higher biting rates of Ae. aegypti. Insemination rates of Ae. polynesiensis females (94.5-98.8%) were consistently greater than those of Ae. aegypti (87.5-93.5%) throughout the study, but there was no significant difference in the insemination rates of either species between months and regions. Parity rates were generally highest in north coast samples and lowest in west coast samples for both species and generally increased (albeit not always significantly) by month for each species, with a range of 52.9-88.8% for Ae. polynesiensis and 28.6-53.6% for Ae. aegypti, although the high gravid rate (15.8-45.9%) of Ae. aegypti samples (reflecting its feeding more than once in a gonotrophic cycle) confounded both intraspecific and interspecific comparisons. Filarial infection was rare in Ae. aegypti, although both W. bancrofti and D. immitis were recorded, and infection rates in Ae. polynesiensis increased through the study period in each region for both filarias, with up to 4.6% infected and 1.4% infective for W. bancrofti and up to 6.3% infected and 2.5% infective for D. immitis. For W. bancrofti, infection rates were significantly lower on the west coast and also in the dry season, whereas rates for infective stages were significantly greater in the late wet season. For D. immitis there was no significant difference in infection rates between regions, but rates were significantly greater in the late wet season. Rainfall in all months sustains populations of both vectors and explains the relatively few significant differences between seasons; however, the wet season may provide for increased vector abundance and longevity, and present a potentially increased risk for transmission. Although the differences shown between regions also were limited in a statistical sense, there were increased risks for the northern and eastern regions, where both locals and tourists are concentrated and where the seaports and airport are located, and these areas should be priority targets for disease surveillance and vector control.",2005,"Russell, R.C., Webb, C.E., Davies, N.",Journal of Medical Entomology,,42(6),1045-1056,,French Polynesia,932,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,English,,PacELF_932 Russell et al 2005 J Med Ent Aedes in French Poly.pdf

There was no difference between the results for laboratory-bred and wild-caught mosquitoes. Aedes polynesiensis fed on low carriers (around 20 Mf ml-1 and less) gave an average infection rate of 4.9%. Each infected mosquito harboured only one larva. A plot of the probit of percentage Ae. polynesiensis positive against the logarithm of microfilarial density showed a linear relationship. Using the regression line, at 95% confidence interval, a microfilarial density of 1 ml-1 would give an infection rate of 0.22-2.51%, a density of 0.1 Mf ml-1 an infection rate of 0.01-1.0%. The concentrating capacity of Ae. polynesiensis ranged from 0.70 to 4.74. As microfilaria densities decreased, concentration increased.

As infection rates decline and MDA programs end, efficient and sensitive methods for detecting infections are needed to monitor for recrudescence. Molecular methods, collectively termed 'molecular xenomonitoring,' can identify parasite DNA or RNA in human blood-feeding mosquitoes. We tested mosquitoes trapped throughout the inhabited islands of American Samoa to identify areas of possible continuing LF transmission after completion of MDA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Mosquitoes were collected using BG Sentinel traps from most of the villages on American Samoa's largest island, Tutuila, and all major villages on the smaller islands of Aunu'u, Ofu, Olosega, and Ta'u. Real-time PCR was used to detect Wuchereria bancrofti DNA in pools of </= 20 mosquitoes, and PoolScreen software was used to infer territory-wide prevalences of W. bancrofti DNA in the mosquitoes. Wuchereria bancrofti DNA was found in mosquitoes from 16 out of the 27 village areas sampled on Tutuila and Aunu'u islands but none of the five villages on the Manu'a islands of Ofu, Olosega, and Ta'u. The overall 95% confidence interval estimate for W. bancrofti DNA prevalence in the LF vector Ae. polynesiensis was 0.20-0.39%, and parasite DNA was also detected in pools of Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Aedes (Finlaya) spp. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest low but widespread prevalence of LF on Tutuila and Aunu'u where 98% of the population resides, but not Ofu, Olosega, and Ta'u islands.

956,JCU,653,,,Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,Neglected diseases and ethnic minorities in the Western Pacific Region exploring the links,"Ethnic minority groups (EMGs) are often subject to exclusion, marginalization and poverty. These characteristics render them particularly vulnerable to neglected diseases, a diverse group of diseases that comprise bacteria, ecto-parasites, fungi, helminths and viruses. Despite the health policy relevance, only little is known of the epidemiological profile of neglected diseases among EMGs. We reviewed country data from Australia, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam and found several overlaps between regions with high proportions of EMG population and high prevalence rates of neglected diseases (infections with soil-transmitted helminths, filarial worms, schistosomes, food-borne trematodes and cestodes). While the links are not always clearly evident and it is impossible to establish correlations among highly aggregated data without control variables-such as environmental factors-there appear indeed to be important linkages between EMGs, socio-economic status and prevalence of neglected diseases. Some determinants under consideration are lack of access to health care and general health status, poverty and social marginalization, as well as education and literacy. Further research is needed to deepen the understanding of these linkages and to determine their public health and socio-economic significance. In particular, there is a need for more data from all countries in the Western Pacific Region that is disaggregated below the provincial level.

The rate of detectable microfilaraemia was effectively reduced from 39% to 11% and mean microfilarial (mf) densities from 79mf/20mul to 19mf/20mul. The Phase 2 annual single-dose treatment of 6mg/kg DEC not only maintained the gains made during Phase 1 but reduced the microfilaraemia rate to less than 5% by 1990, with mf densities remaining stable at less than 20mf/20mul, amongst all participating villagers screened within the 5 original villages. The annual treatment program was expanded into 7 remote villages not subject to any form of active vector control. The microfilaraemia rate in these villages declined from 41% before treatment to 17% after only two annual administrations of 6mg/kg DEC, and mf blood densities were reduced from 71mf/20mul to 20mf/20mul. As was observed in the 5 original villages participating in the program, a significant reduction in splenomegaly associated with the DEC treatment was reported for the 7 villages in the expanded program during Phase 2; enlarged spleen rates were reduced from 50% (1986) to 32% (1990) and from 76% (1988) to 48% (1990), respectively.

Recent work has indicated that locality-specific bio-ecological complexities affecting parasite transmission may complicate the prediction of LF extinction endpoints, casting uncertainty on the achievement of this initiative. One source of difficulty is the limited quantity and quality of data used to parameterize models of parasite transmission, implying the important need to update initially-derived parameter values. Sequential analysis of longitudinal data following annual MDAs will also be important to gaining new understanding of the persistence dynamics of LF. Here, we apply a Bayesian statistical-dynamical modelling framework that enables assimilation of information in human infection data recorded from communities in Papua New Guinea that underwent annual MDAs, into our previously developed model of parasite transmission, in order to examine these questions in LF ecology and control. RESULTS: Biological parameters underlying transmission obtained by fitting the model to longitudinal data remained stable throughout the study period. This enabled us to reliably reconstruct the observed baseline data in each community. Endpoint estimates also showed little variation. However, the updating procedure showed a shift towards higher and less variable values for worm kill but not for any other drug-related parameters. An intriguing finding is that the stability in key biological parameters could be disrupted by a significant reduction in the vector biting rate prevailing in a locality. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal invariance of biological parameters in the face of intervention perturbations indicates a robust adaptation of LF transmission to local ecological conditions. The results imply that understanding the mechanisms that underlie locally adapted transmission dynamics will be integral to identifying points of system fragility, and thus countermeasures to reliably facilitate LF extinction both locally and globally.",2013,"Singh, B.K., Bockarie, M.J., Gambhir, M., Siba, P.M., Tisch, D.J., Kazura, J., Michael, E.",PLoS ONE,,8(6),e67004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067004,Papua New Guinea,966,Open  ,,,English,,PacELF_966 Singh et al 2013 PLOS ONE Sequential modeling of effects of Mass drug treatments on anopheline mediated LF infection in PNG.pdf

Our studies of LF in Papua New Guinea (PNG) have shown that it is possible to reduce the prevalence of Wb in humans and mosquitoes through mass drug administration (MDA; diethylcarbamazine with/without ivermectin). While MDAs in the Dreikikir region through 1998 significantly reduced prevalence of Wb infection, parasites continue to be transmitted in the area. METHODS: We sequenced the Wb mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase 1 (CO1) gene from 16 people infected with Wb. Patients were selected from 7 villages encompassing both high and moderate annual transmission potentials (ATP). We collected genetic data with the objectives to (i) document contemporary levels of genetic diversity and (ii) distinguish between populations of parasites and hosts across the study area. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We discovered 109 unique haplotypes currently segregating in the Wb parasite population, with one common haplotype present in 15 out of 16 infections. We found that parasite diversity was similar among people residing within the same village and clustered within transmission zones. For example, in the high transmission area, diversity tended to be more similar between neighboring villages, while in the moderate transmission area, diversity tended to be less similar. CONCLUSIONS: In the Dreikikir region of PNG there are currently high levels of genetic diversity in populations of Wb. High levels of genetic diversity may complicate future MDAs in this region and the presence of dominant haplotypes will require adjustments to current elimination strategies.",2013,"Small, S.T., Ramesh, A., Bun, K., Reimer, L., Thomsen, E., Baea, M., Bockarie, M.J., Siba, P., Kazura, J.W., Tisch, D.J., Zimmerman, P.A.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,,7(7),e2308,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002308,Papua New Guinea,967,Open  ,,,English,,PacELF_967 Small et al 2013 PLOS NTD Population genetics of the filarial worm W bancrofti in post treatment PNG.pdf

Current tools available to monitor LF are limited to diagnostic tests targeting DNA repeats, filarial antigens, and anti-filarial antibodies. While these tools are useful for detection and surveillance, elimination programs have yet to take full advantage of molecular typing for inferring infection history, strain fingerprinting, and evolution. To date, molecular typing approaches have included whole mitochondrial genomes, genotyping, targeted sequencing, and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs). These studies have revealed much about Wb biology. For example, in one study in Papua New Guinea researchers identified 5 major strains that were widespread and many minor strains some of which exhibit geographic stratification. Genome data, while rare, has been utilized to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among taxa of the Onchocercidae (the clade of filarial nematodes) and identify gene synteny. Their phylogeny reveals that speciation from the common ancestor of both B. malayi and Wb occurred around 5-6 millions years ago with shared ancestry to other filarial nematodes as recent as 15 million years ago. These discoveries hold promise for gene discovery and identifying drug targets in species that are more amenable to in vivo experiments. Continued technological developments in whole genome sequencing and data analysis will likely replace many other forms of molecular typing, multiplying the amount of data available on population structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetics. Once widely available, the addition of population genetic data from genomic studies should hasten the elimination of LF parasites like Wb. Infectious disease control programs have benefited greatly from population genetics data and recently from population genomics data. However, while there is currently a surplus of data for diseases like malaria and HIV, there is a scarcity of this data for filarial nematodes. With the falling cost of genome sequencing, research on filarial nematodes could benefit from the addition of population genetics statistics and phylogenetics especially in dealing with elimination programs. A comprehensive review focusing on population genetics of filarial nematode does not yet exist. Here our goal is to provide a current overview of the molecular epidemiology of W. bancrofti (Wb) the primary causative agent of LF. We begin by reviewing studies utilizing molecular typing techniques with specific focus on genomic and population datasets. Next, we used whole mitochondrial genome data to construct a phylogeny and examine the evolutionary history of the Onchocercidae. Then, we provide a perspective to aid in understanding how population genetic techniques translate to modern epidemiology.

Mathematical models describing observed mf-L3 functional responses for each of the major three parasite-transmitting vector genera, Aedes, Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes, were fitted to paired mf-L3 data collated from all available studies in the published literature. Model parameters were estimated and compared by deriving and applying a data synthetic framework, based on applying a non-linear weighted regression model for fitting mathematical models to multistudy data. The results confirm previous findings of the existence of significant between-genera differences in the mf-L3 development relationship, particularly with regard to the occurrence of limitation in Culex mosquitoes and facilitation in Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes. New and unexpected findings regarding L3 development from ingested mf were discovered as follows: (1) for Culex, overcompensation in L3 development at higher intensities of mf (or a peaked mf-L3 functional response) was detected; (2) for Aedes mosquitoes, facilitation (with an apparent asymptotic constraint on L3 development at high mf densities) was shown to be the major process governing L3 development, and (3) for Anopheles, a stronger facilitation type of response with no apparent saturation in L3 development appears to govern L3 output from ingested mf.

Here, we use data on mosquito feeding experiments collated from the published literature to examine the available evidence regarding the functional form of the first component of this parasite-vector relationship for Wuchereria bancrofti (Filarioidea: Onchocercidae) causing Bancroftian filariasis, i.e. the rate of microfilariae (mf) uptake from the blood of infected humans by the feeding mosquito vector. Using a simple logarithmic regression model for describing the observed relationships between the mean numbers of mf ingested per mosquito and parasite load in humans in each study, and a linear mixed-effects meta-analytical framework for synthesizing the observed regressions across studies, we show here for the first time clear evidence for the existence of density-dependence in this process for all the three major filariasis transmitting mosquito vectors. An important finding of this study is that this regulation of mf uptake also varies significantly between the vector genera, being weakest in Culex, comparatively stronger in Aedes and most severe and occurring at significantly lower human mf loads in Anopheles mosquitoes. The analysis of the corresponding mf uptake prevalence data has further highlighted how density-dependence in mf uptake may influence the observed distributions of mf in vector populations. These results show that whereas strong regulation of mf uptake, especially when it leads to saturation in uptake at low human parasite intensities, can lead to static distributions of mf per mosquito with host parasite intensity, a weaker regulation of mf ingestion can give rise to changes in both mean mf loads and in the frequency distribution of parasites/mosquito with increasing human parasite intensity. These findings highlight the importance of considering local vector infection dynamics when attempting to predict the impacts of community-based filariasis control. They also emphasize the value of developing and applying robust meta-analytic methods for estimating functional relationships regarding parasitic infection from population ecological data.",2002,"Snow, L.C., Michael, E.",Medical and Veterinary Entomology,,16(4),409-423,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2915.2002.00396.x,Multicountry Global,970,Open via Publisher,,,English,,PacELF_970 Snow and Michael 2002 MED VET ENT.pdf

To examine its usefulness in a single filarial-endemic island assessed at two time points with markedly different levels of transmission, Ab to Wb123 was measured in sera collected from subjects from Mauke, Cook Islands in 1975 (no previous treatment) and 1992 (5 years after a one time island-wide treatment with diethylcarbamazine [DEC]). FINDINGS: Between 1975 and 1992, Wb transmission decreased dramatically as evidenced by reduced prevalences of microfilariae (31% vs. 5%) and circulating Ag (CAg, 49% vs. 16%). Age specific prevalence analysis showed a dramatic reduction in Wb123 Ab positivity from 54% (25/46) in 1975 to 8% (3/38) in 1992 in children 1-5 years (p<0.0001), reflecting the effects of single-dose treatment five years earlier. By 1992, Wb123 Ab prevalence in children 6-10 years had fallen from 75% (42/56) in 1975 to 42% (33/79) consistent with a lower cumulative transmission potential. In the whole population, Wb123 seropositivity decreased from 86% to 60% between 1975 and 1992. In CAg+ subjects the levels of Wb123 Ab were indistinguishable between the 2 time points but differed in those who were CAg- (p<0.0001). In paired sample analysis, individuals who were CAg+ in 1975 but became CAg- in 1992 had significantly lower Ab levels in 1992 (p<0.0001), with 9/40 (23%) becoming seronegative for Wb123.

980,JCU,677,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Altered T cell memory and effector cell development in chronic lymphatic filarial infection that is independent of persistent parasite antigen,"Chronic lymphatic filarial (LF) infection is associated with suppression of parasite-specific T cell responses that persist even following elimination of infection. While several mechanisms have been implicated in mediating this T cell specific downregulation, a role for alterations in the homeostasis of T effector and memory cell populations has not been explored. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we investigated the role of persistent filarial infection on the maintenance of T cell memory in patients from the filarial-endemic Cook Islands. Compared to filarial-uninfected endemic normals (EN), microfilaria (mf) positive infected patients (Inf) had a reduced CD4 central memory (T(CM)) compartment. In addition, Inf patients tended to have more effector memory cells (T(EM)) and fewer effector cells (T(EFF)) than did ENs giving significantly smaller T(EFF):T(EM) ratios. These contracted T(CM) and T(EFF) populations were still evident in patients previously mf+ who had cleared their infection (CLInf). Moreover, the density of IL-7Ralpha, necessary for T memory cell maintenance (but decreased in T effector cells), was significantly higher on memory cells of Inf and CLInf patients, although there was no evidence for decreased IL-7 or increased soluble IL7-Ralpha, both possible mechanisms for signaling defects in memory cells. However, effector cells that were present in Inf and CLInf patients had lower percentages of HLA-DR suggesting impaired function. These changes in T cell populations appear to reflect chronicity of infection, as filarial-infected children, despite the presence of active infection, did not show alterations in the frequencies of these T cell phenotypes. These data indicate that filarial-infected patients have contracted T(CM) compartments and a defect in effector cell development, defects that persist even following clearance of infection. The fact that these global changes in memory and effector cell compartments do not yet occur in infected children makes early treatment of LF even more crucial.",2011,"Steel, C., Nutman, T.B.",PLoS ONE,,6(4),e19197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019197,Cook Islands,980,Open  ,,,English,,PacELF_980 Steel and Nutman PLOS ONE 2011 Altered T cell memor.pdf

The safety and efficacy of a single-dose triple-drug therapy of widely used antifilarial drugs diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin (IVM), and albendazole (ALB) for LF is unknown.

The ongoing global program to eliminate filariasis using mass drug administration is expected to decrease this and other forms of filarial morbidity in the future by preventing establishment of new infections as a consequence of eliminating transmission by the mosquito vector.

Comparing values before treatment and one year after four annual treatments, the proportion of microfilaria positive individuals declined to the greatest degree, with less marked change in antibody and antigen rates. Considering children as sentinel groups who reflect recent transmission intensity, children surveyed before the trial were more frequently microfilaria and antibody positive than those examined one year after the trial stopped. In contrast, antigen positive rates were similar in the two groups.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Residents of rural villages near Madang were studied prior to and one year after each of three rounds of MDA with diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole administered per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The mean MDA compliance rate was 72.9%. Three rounds of MDA decreased microfilaremia rates (Mf, 1 ml night blood by filter) from 18.6% pre-MDA to 1.3% after the third MDA (a 94% decrease). Mf clearance rates in infected persons were 71%, 90.7%, and 98.1% after 1, 2, and 3 rounds of MDA. Rates of filarial antigenemia assessed by card test (a marker for adult worm infection) decreased from 47.5% to 17.1% (a 64% decrease) after 3 rounds of MDA. The filarial antibody rate (IgG(4) antibodies to Bm14, an indicator of filarial infection status and/or exposure to mosquito-borne infective larvae) decreased from 59.3% to 25.1% (a 54.6% decrease). Mf, antigen, and antibody rates decreased more rapidly in children <11 years of age (by 100%, 84.2%, and 76.8%, respectively) relative to older individuals, perhaps reflecting their lighter infections and shorter durations of exposure/infection prior to MDA. Incidence rates for microfilaremia, filarial antigenemia, and antifilarial antibodies also decreased significantly after MDA. Filarial DNA rates in Anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes that had recently taken a blood meal decreased from 15.1% to 1.0% (a 92.3% decrease). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MDA had dramatic effects on all filariasis parameters in the study area and also reduced incidence rates.

In this article, Gary Weil, Patrick Lammie and Niggi Weiss review their experience with a new rapid-format filarial antigen test. They found that the ICT card test was very easy to perform and that it was comparable with ELISA for the detection of filarial antigen in sera from people with microfilaremia.

To evaluate the efficacy of screening larger blood samples by PCR, both 100 microL and 500 microL samples from 50 patients with very low-level microfilaraemia were screened by the SspI PCR assay; the sensitivity increased from 60% to 84% when using the larger volume of blood. Finally, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based version of the SspI PCR assay was used to screen blood from 12 patients following treatment with diethylcarbamazine, ivermectin, or both.

However, on Misima Island in Milne Bay Province, government and private sectors have collaborated to implement a pilot elimination programme. Although interim evaluation indicated that the programme has been parasitologically successful, an appreciation that sustainable health gains depend on understanding and accommodating local beliefs prompted this qualitative study. METHODS: We investigated Misima community members knowledge and attitudes about lymphatic filariasis and the elimination programme. A combination of focus groups and key informant interviews were used to explore participants perceptions of health; knowledge of the aetiology and symptoms of filariasis, elephantiasis and hydrocele; attitudes towards the disease and mass drug distribution; and the social structure and decision-making protocols within the villages. RESULTS: Focus group discussions proved inferior to key informant interviews for gathering rich data. Study participants did not consider lymphatic filariasis (""pom"") a major health problem but were generally positive about mass drug administration campaigns. A variety of conditions were frequently and incorrectly attributed to filariasis. Participants expressed the belief that individuals infected with filariasis always had visible manifestations of disease. A common misconception was that taking drugs during campaigns provided long-term immunity against disease. The role of mosquito vectors in transmission was not generally appreciated and certain clinical presentations, particularly hydrocele, were associated with supernatural forces. Multiple adverse events were associated with mass drug administration campaigns and most study participants mentioned community members who did not participate in campaigns. CONCLUSION: Important issues requiring educational intervention and elimination activity modification in the Misima region were identified during this study.

1138,JCU,81,JCU WHOCC,,Electronic/Hardcopy,Mission Reports,Mission Report. Lymphatic filariasis Samoa 3-7 April 2008,"Objectives of mission: 
In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and a COMBI expert: to provide support for the development of a “Communication for Behavioural Impact” (COMBI) plan for the Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. 
Summary of activities, findings, conclusions and recommendations: 
The writer worked with a COMBI expert from WHO/HQ Mrs Asiya Odugleh-Kolev. They met with the Assistant CEO of Health, the coordinator of the LF program and the LF/MDA committee. They conducted individual interviews with young males, village mayors, household members in one low compliance/high prevalence area and one high compliance/low prevalence area. They also conducted interviews with women’s representatives who were involved in tablets distribution during the previous MDA. These activities were conducted with the LF coordinator from the MOH, the WHO SSA in charge of the LF program, two staff from the MOH, one of them trained in COMBI in Fiji in 2007 but who never had an opportunity to practice and use her COMBI skills. Therefore this visit was used as an on-the-spot training on interviews and on how to gather information to develop a communication plan. Youth interviews were carried out using Top-Of-the-Mind-Analysis (TOMA) and Day-In-the-Life-Of (DILO) questionnaires and opened questions with key informants. 
On Saturday evening the data collected were entered into an Excel database, analysed and discussed by the MOH/WHO team. A powerpoint presentation highlighting the main findings and recommendations was prepared and presented to the ACEO on Sunday afternoon. A discussion followed the presentation on communication strategies needed in order to improve MDA coverage and reach the target of at least 85% of the general population ingesting the drugs. This plan (slides 25 to 33 of the power point presentation) will need to be further fed and developed by the MOH team based on additional interviews to be conducted in urban areas in particular. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Despite a low MDA coverage (below 70%) for three out of six rounds the MDA carried out since 1999 have effectively reduced antigenemia and microfilaremia prevalence to low levels. However, the target of below 1% antigenemia prevalence has not been reached and the increase of the ICT and Mf prevalence between 2004 and 2007 is a concern even if the methods used for the sampling method are not exactly the same. The fact that during the 2007 survey LF antigen and Mf has been detected in children indicating that transmission has occurred in the past five years is also of concern. Additional rounds of “improved Mass Drug Administration” will be needed starting 2008. In order to achieve a coverage of at least 85% of the total population ingesting the drugs during the next rounds of MDA a number of activities focusing on new distribution and communication strategies will be needed as per the plan discussed with the MOH on the last day of this mission. It will be of tremendous importance to get a strong social mobilisation based on the communication plans and activities developed during this mission. Specific messages will need to be developed to reach each of the target audience identified: young males, elderly, female and usually compliant people, etc 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1) A minimum of two additional rounds of “improved MDA” should be implemented starting in 2008 with a targeted coverage of at least 85% of the general population AND at least 85% of the male group. The distribution strategy should be a directly observed treatment. A special attention should be paid to the previously “too old” and “too sick” categories and a specific strategy developed for this particular group. 
2) The strong leadership and new directions taken by the Ministry of Health demonstrate a high commitment and all efforts should be made to support the new strategy and the focused distribution in three days. The important shift from a long timeframe to a short time frame distribution, from a passive attitude to an active behaviour from the communities, from a non DOT to a DOT strategy will need a well organiosed and comprehensive communication plan. 
3) The breakdown of the budget needed for this MDA should be urgently finalised to approach donors and partners. 
4) The communication strategy discussed during this mission and presented to the MOH on the last day of this visit (attached powerpoint presentation) should be further developed and implemented. It will be of tremendous importance to mobilise and get strong support from all sectors, leaders and media if the target is going to be met.

GPELF has expanded its mass drug administration (MDA) coverage with the recommended two-drug co-administration from a modest 3 million people in 12 countries in 2000 to more than 70 million in 36 countries during 2003. In addition, as part of an ongoing programme, India has covered an additional number of people with diethylcar-bamazine citrate (DEC) alone. In 2002, the population in the implementation units (IUs) covered exceeded the anticipated targets that were laid down in GPELF’s strategic plan developed in 1999. Encouraged by this rapid expansion, the partners of the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) set the target for MDA coverage at 350 million people in 2005. Subsequently, a strategic plan for scaling up to achieve the target was developed in 2003 in consultation with partners, including the endemic countries. This strategic plan covering the period 2003–2005 was approved by TAG-LF. To ensure that this target is realistic, however, and to assess the resource requirements, each endemic country with an active programme was requested to provide a forecast of scaling up of MDA for the period 2004–2008. The forecast was to include funding requirements, with an indication of resources that would be provided by the ministry of health. Feedback has been received from the countries and is in the process of being analyzed. The results will be made available in due course.",2003,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,,154,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-CDS-CPE-CEE-2005.52,Multicountry Global ,1152,Open,"MDA, blood survey, Midterm, TAS, MMDP,","TAG-LF, Stopping MDA, PacCARE, Country reports, Report Form, Global alliance, Financial aspects",English,,PacELF_1152 WHO Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic filariasis Annual report on Lymphatic filariasis 2003.pdf

Lymphatic filariasis continues to be the major cause of disability in the world, and approximately 120 million people are infected. The disease is endemic in 80 countries and territories, 32 of which have implemented active elimination programmes – 10 more than in 2001. Nevertheless, the challenge remains considerable: although these 32 countries and territories represent almost 80% of the global at-risk population, they have covered only 5% of their own at-risk population with mass drug administration (MDA). Despite this, progress is encouraging since these countries reported a satisfactory drug coverage rate that established a promising foundation for future scaling-up of the elimination programmes.There is an urgent need to inject more energy into advocacy and fundraising: capacity building is a crucial component of the Global Programme and requires continuous enhancement. In addition, social and political support from the endemic countries is vital for the success of the Programme.",2002,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,,118,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-CDS-CPE-CEE-2003.38,Multicountry Global ,1153,Open ,"MDA, blood survey, Midterm, MMDP",,English,,PacELF_1153 WHO Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis Annual report on Lymphatic Filariasis 2002.pdf

There are more than a billion people who are at risk of lymphatic filariasis, which is not a killer disease. The infection is caused by thread- like worms (filariae) which lodge in the lymphatic system, producing millions of minute larvae (microfilariae) that circulate in the blood. Although infection often occurs in childhood, the symptoms are commonly delayed until adulthood. Over 120 million people are currently living with the disease, including about 40 million who are incapacitated and disfigured by it. Of all diseases, lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability. Until recently, the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis depended on night blood examinations to detect microfilariae. Now, there is an antigen-detection test that can be taken at any time of the day, making it feasible to map the disease geographically. Drugs, which are available free or at low cost, kill the microfilariae in the blood. Simple methods of hygiene and self-care can reduce the effects of the disease. With such effective tools to hand, the Fiftieth World Health Assembly, in 1997, resolved to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem.

1213,NGSK,318,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Electronic/Hardcopy,Guidelines and Instructional Materials,Guidelines for Certifying Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination,"Overview: Widespread interest in and support for a global campaign to eliminate lymphatic filariasis has developed and grown in the 1990s. In 1997 the World Health Assembly endorsed efforts to eliminate transmission of filariasis on a country by country basis (WHA resolution 50.29). Filariasis is a disease which is endemic in communities worldwide affecting an estimated 120 million persons. Table 1 lists those countries where human filariasis has been: (i) endemic during the 1980s and 1990s, (ii) endemic or possibly endemic before 1980 but not recognized since then, (iii) sporadically reported without evidence of endemic disease. In 1998, there is still lack of knowledge about when transmission of filariasis was interrupted in many countries. The need for certification of attainment is inherent in the goal of an elimination programme; such a need does not exist for control programmes. There must be an objective basis, according to agreed criteria, for determining whether transmission of filariasis has indeed been eliminated; the criteria must take into account the risk of importation from filariasis endemic countries. It is expected that efforts towards elimination of filariasis transmission for individual countries will be conducted until the global certification of elimination of filariasis is achieved. In order to complete the process of certifying elimination, an independent International Commission for the Certification of Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination (ICCLFE) will be established by World Health Organization (WHO). This commission will recommend to the Organization those countries that fulfil the requirements for certification, as well as advise the Organization on criteria, procedures and progress made towards elimination of filariasis transmission. The commission will also designate a panel of specialists, whose members can be assigned to International Certification Teams (ICTs). WHO, including the Regional offices, will facilitate national preparations for certification by carrying out regular visits by WHO staff, members of the designated ICT, or consultants to the country or sub-region concerned. A register will be established of countries requesting certification and also of those countries where official certification of elimination is pending. Finally WHO will also establish an official register of countries where filariasis has been eliminated, ba5ed on evaluations by the ICCLFE. The aim of the present document is to describe the criteria for verifying the absence of filariasis transmission. In addition WHO has developed a document addressing issues of disease ascertainment, monitoring, and pre-elimination surveillance - i.e., addressing the various issues before elimination certification (see document WHO/FIL/99.195).",1998,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,,20,https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/66441/WHO_FIL_99_197.pdf?sequence=1,Multicountry Global ,1213,Open,"MDA, TAS, blood survey,","Criteria for certification, Certification procedures, Pre-Certification Activities,",English,,PacELF_1213 WHO 1998 Guidelines for Certifying Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination.pdf

By the end of 2011, 53 of 73 endemic countries were implementing mass drug administration, and more than 3.9 billion treatments had been delivered to 952 million people. Challenges remain, however, in meeting the goal of eliminating the disease. Vector control is a possible complementary strategy in countries or areas (i) where mass drug administration has not started, such as those where loiasis is co-endemic; (ii) where the burden of lymphatic filariasis is heaviest and mass drug administration must be rapidly scaled up or (iii) where the expected impact of mass drug administration has not been achieved; and where local transmission has been interrupted to prevent recurrence. This document explains why vector control is important in national programmes and describes the preparation of a tailor-made control plan for national programmes. It outlines entomological procedures for regular and specific vector control and how data should be analysed for better overall understanding of filarial transmission and vectors. The document will also be useful for teaching personnel in lymphatic filariasis programmes about the use and value of entomological procedures in overall epidemiological appraisal in the context of elimination. Designed for national lymphatic elimination programme managers and for entomologists and parasitologists, this practical handbook will also be useful for programme staff working at regional and district levels, including those involved in vector control; development and technical agencies; nongovernmental organizations; and other organizations that support national programmes.",2013,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,,107,https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241505642,Multicountry Global ,1215,Open,"vector control, MDA","entomology, vector sampling, tailor-made vector control",English; French,Manual about mosquitos,PacELF_1215 WHO 2013 Lymphatic filariasis A handbook of practical entomology.pdf

Eleven persons remained microfilaremic, whereas 18 had cleared both microfilaremia and antigenemia. Despite decreased infection on the island, antibody levels remained relatively constant for the subjects with persistent microfilaremia (Mf+/+), in contrast to sharp decreases for both EN subjects and subjects with cleared microfilaremia (Mf+/-). Although clinically indistinguishable from the EN subjects, the Mf+/- group had antibody levels (IgG, IgG4, and IgE) significantly lower than those of the EN subjects. Lymphocyte responses to parasite antigens were marginally greater in Mf+/- than in Mf+/+ subjects, but both groups remained less cell responsive (as measured by proliferation, interleukin-5, interleukin-10, interferon-γ, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) than did the EN subjects.

1225,NGSK,94,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Electronic/Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,Lymphatic filariasis elimination: Progress in global programme development,"The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) is an innovative, public-private partnership for health improvement. The progress made since the programme was initiated, in 1998, is here reviewed. The programme is largely based on the regular mass administration of albendazole with either ivermectin (Mectizan®) or diethylcarbamazine. Both albendazole and ivermectin have been donated by their manufacturers, for as long as necessary. The first national campaigns based on these drugs commenced in late 1999. Since then, rapid progress has been made in confirming the safety of the drug combinations, establishing a regional approach, and recognizing that experiences, epidemiological settings, health systems, the best drug combinations and disease burdens all vary with the country involved. There is a continuing trend towards decentralization, and this should lead to greater regional and national ownership and more inter-country activities. The progress made in mapping the geographical distribution of lymphatic filariasis (LF), by designated implementation units and, ultimately, by country, is also summarized. Country-specific methods of social mobilization and drug distribution, that are compatible with health planning at central and district level, need to be developed. However, the assessment of coverage by mass drug administration (MDA) needs to be strengthened, to allow reliable national monitoring and inter-country or inter-region comparisons. Valuable contributions made by non-governmental development organizations (NGDO) and civil society organizations (CSO) are acknowledged, such organizations (and particularly local NGDO) should be encouraged to help more in implementing the various activities at district level. The GPELF has developed during an era of considerable change in international health policy. The programme can contribute to the relief of poverty, as LF is closely associated with low-income communities in the least developed countries and MDA is a pro-poor intervention. There are clear opportunities for linking the activities of the GPELF (which uses cheap or free drugs that bring considerable incidental health benefits, in addition to arresting the transmission of the parasites causing LF) with other health interventions. New evidence indicates that annual treatments with antifilarial drugs greatly reduce the clinical abnormalities of the disease. The programme has expanded rapidly, with the annual number of people treated rising from 2.9 million (in 12 countries) in the year 2000 to 25.89 million (in 22 countries) in 2001 and an estimated 80 million (in 34 countries) in 2002. At the recent meeting of the Global Alliance, held in New Delhi in May 2002, a significant but realistic challenge - of scaling-up the programme to cover up to 350 million of those at risk, by the end of 2005 - was set. The rate of growth necessary to meet this target presents considerable strategic and managerial challenges to all of the partners involved in the programme, from the development of synergies with other, large-scale, public-health interventions to the logistics of drug manufacture, shipping and local transportation and resolving the problems of social mobilization, reporting, evaluation and monitoring on such a scale. Such challenges are, however, easily outweighed by the potential benefits of success. If the international health community cannot provide the necessary support to complement the investments being made by the endemic countries (as they scale-up their LF-elimination campaigns and ensure yearly access to two free and efficacious drugs that bring major benefits to those treated), significant progress in the control of other infectious diseases becomes a very distant goal.",2002,"Molyneux, D.H., Zagaria, N.",Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology,,96 (SUPPL. 2),S15-S40,,Multicountry Global,1225,Open,,"NGDO, DEC, albendazole",English,,PacELF_1225 Molyneux and Zagaria 2002 ATMP Lymphatic filariasis elimination progress in global programme development.pdf

1229,NGSK,99,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Electronic/Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,The argument for integrating vector control with multiple drug administration campaigns to ensure elimination of lymphatic filariasis,"Background: There is a danger that mass drug administration campaigns may fail to maintain adequate treatment coverage to achieve lymphatic filariasis elimination. Hence, additional measures to suppress transmission might be needed to ensure the success of the Global Program for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis. Discussion: Vector control successfully eliminated lymphatic filariasis when implemented alone or with mass drug administration. Challenges to lymphatic filariasis elimination include uncertainty of the exact level and duration of microfilarial suppression required for elimination, the mobility of infected individuals, consistent non-participation of some infected individuals with mass drug administration, the possible development of anti-filarial drug resistance and treatment strategies in areas co-endemic with loasis. Integration of vector control with mass drug administration can address some of these challenges. The potential benefits of vector control would include: (1) the ability to suppress filariasis transmission without the need to identify all individual 'foci of infection'; (2) minimizing the risk of reestablishment of transmission from imported microfilaria positive individuals; and (3) decreasing the risk of dengue or malaria transmission where, respectively, Aedes or Anopheles are lymphatic filariasis vectors. Summary: With adequate sustained treatment coverage, mass drug administration should meet the criteria for elimination of lymphatic filariasis. However, it may be difficult to sustain sufficiently high mass drug administration coverage to achieve lymphatic filariasis elimination in some areas, particularly, where Aedes species are the vectors. Since vector control was effective in controlling and even eliminating lymphatic filariasis transmission, integration of vector control with mass drug administration will ensure the sustainability of transmission suppression and thereby, better ensure the success of national filariasis elimination programs. Although trials of some vector control interventions are needed, proven vector control strategies are ready for immediate integration with mass drug administration for many important vectors. Vector control is the only presently available additional lymphatic filariasis control measure with the potential for immediate implementation.",2006,"Burkot, T.R., Durrheim, D.N., Melrose, W.D., Speare, R., Ichimori, K.",Filaria Journal,,5(10),7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2883-5-10,Multicountry Pacific,1229,Open,MDA,"vector control, DEC, albendazole, mf rate, GPELF",English,,PacELF_1229 Burkot et al 2006 FILARIA J The argument for integrating vector control 1475-2883-5-10.pdf

Diversity in immune response presumably may lead to myriad clinical presentations, such as overt chronic filariasis, occult filariasis with atypical systemic manifestation and asymptomatic microfilariae carrier state. Anticipated oxidative stress during inflammatory response to infective conditions might complicate the immune response and thus might alter the disease outcome. The present study was carried out to assess the status of oxidative stress in different clinical presentations of bancroftian filariasis. Twenty-five microfilariae carriers and 30 cases each of chronic filariasis and occult filariasis were compared to 30 endemic normal individuals. Serum malondialdehyde level and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity were measured by spectrophotometric methods and levels of filarial antigen were measured by ELISA. In the filarial cases, the levels of these parameters were assayed again after treatment with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC). Results showed significant (P < 0.05) association of oxidative stress with chronic and occult filariasis but not with microfilarial carriers. DEC therapy in both clinical cases and carriers resulted in a significant reduction of oxidative stress associated with decreased antigen level (P < 0.01).

The public health importance of lymphatic filariasis has generated a large body of research in this area, both in laboratory studies (Ottesen, 1984,1989; Maizels & Lawrence, 1991) and in the field (Hayashi, 1962; Hairston & Jachowski, 1968; Denham & McGreevy, 1977; Vanamail et al. 1989 b; Bundy, Grenfell & Rajagopalan, 1991; Srividya et al. 1991 b). Despite this, there is still no conclusive explanation for the apparently complex relationship between infection and clinical disease observed in human communities. At least part of the problem may lie in the current impossibility of measuring adult worm burden in vivo (Pichon et al. 1980; Denham & Fletcher, 1987; Das et al. 1990; Grenfell et al.1990). Although there has recently been significant progress in the development of immuno logical markers for infection status in humans (Ottesen, 1989; Day et al. 1991 a), microfilaraemia is still the most reliable measure of current infection in the field. Studies in endemic areas indicate that, far from there being any simple direct relationship between microfilaraemia and disease status, it is possible to find some individuals with microfilariae in their blood but no disease, and indeed with all other combinations of infection and disease status (Hairston & de-Meillon, 1968; Hairston & Jachowski, 1968; Beaver, 1970; Bryan & Southgate, 1976; Denham & McGreevy, 1977; Pani et al. 1991).

Previous control efforts including sporadic mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns have reduced the prevalence to low levels but have not succeeded in eliminating the disease. To effectively plan, model and evaluate the worldwide elimination effort, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPFLF) needs data on filariasis epidemiology (including age and sex-specific prevalence and the density of microfilariae (Mf)) and estimates of the number of years of MDA required for elimination. The five-year nationwide MDA campaign carried out in Samoa before the start of the Pacific Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PacELF) generated extensive data on these issues. Methodology⁄Principal Findings: MDA campaigns were conducted in Samoa with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in 1993 to 1995 and DEC plus ivermectin in 1996 to 1997 for all persons aged 2 years and above. Coverage of the MDA, as assessed from the campaign village register books, ranged from 62% to 97% depending on the year, and was over 80% in three out of five years. Village based surveys showed that prevalence of Mf declined from 4.3% in 1993 (N=10,256) to 1.1% in 1998 (N=4,054) (Pχ2=94.4, p<0.001). Males had a three- to five-fold higher prevalence than females, and this difference remained consistent over the five-year period. Transmission was still occurring over the period as shown by the occurrence of new infections in 3 children less than 5 years old out of 5,691 tested (five-year cumulative incidence of 0.53 per thousand children for the period 1993 to 1998). There was a statistically significant reduction in the geometric mean number of Mf per 60 μl in positive cases between 1993 (11.8) and 1998 (6.9) (t=2.61; p<0.01). The proportion of people with a high density of Mf - over 60 Mf per 60 μl (1000 per ml) - declined from to 19.4% to 4.0% (Pχ2=5.6, p=0.018). Conclusions⁄Significance: Five years of sustained MDA with DEC (3 years) and DEC plus ivermectin (2 years) reduced the prevalence of Mf of W.bancrofti in Samoa by 74%. Density of Mf in infected individuals was also significantly reduced. Males had a three to five-fold higher prevalence than women. New infections in children less than five years old still occurred at a low level, suggesting that transmission was not completely interrupted. These findings helped to prepare a sound monitoring and evaluation plan for PacELF.",2007,"Ichimori, K., Tupuimalagi-Toelupe, P., Toeaso Iosia, V., Graves, P.M.",Tropical Medicine and Health,,35(3),261-269,http://doi.org/10.2149/tmh.35.261,Samoa,1265,Open via Publisher,"country Information, elimination, MDA, DEC, blood surveys","elephantiasis, DEC, ivermectin, coverage, positive mf",English,,PacELF_1265 Ichimori et al 2007 Trop Med Hlth LF Samoa before PacELF.pdf

The meeting was opened by Dr H. Endo, Director, Department of Control, Prevention, and Eradication (CPE) of the Communicable Diseases Cluster. Dr Endo welcomed all the participants and thanked TAG-ELF members for contributing their time and expertise. He pointed out that the meeting was particularly critical because of the financial crisis affecting WHO and the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF). The meeting was attended by all 14 members of TAG-ELF. Other participants were members of the WHO Secretariat, staff of the WHO Regional Offices for Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific, technical experts to advise TAG-ELF on specific issues, and observers from the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF). Dr K.Y. Dadzie continued to serve as Chairman and Dr D. Addiss was appointed Rapporteur. Dr Dadzie welcomed the participants and introduced two new TAG-ELF members- Professor Dato Dr C.P. Ramachandran (Malaysia) and Dr Addiss (USA). A full list of participants is given in Annex 1. Dr Dadzie suggested minor rescheduling of the agenda. Dr Ramachandran moved to accept the revised agenda and this was seconded by Dr R. Henderson. The agenda adopted is given in Annex 2. Dr Henderson pointed out that the fmancial crisis affecting WHO was also felt by the filariasis elimination programmes at country level, and suggested that ""packaging"" lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination with programmes for the control of other parasitic diseases, such as intestinal helminths, might have advantages. Dr Dadzie agreed and indicated that this issue would be addressed on the agenda.",2004,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,,38,http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/68745/CDS_CPE_CEE_2004.42.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,Multicountry Global,1293,Contact PacELF at JCU,"MDA, blood survey, Mapping,TAS","Switzerland, loaloa, single drugs, stop MDA,",English,French version can be found at publishers site,PacELF_1293 TAG-ELF Fifth meeting 2004.pdf

Over the same period, the global burden of non-communicable diseases has increased absolutely and relative to communicable diseases. In this changing landscape, national programmes for the control of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases must be reinforced and adapted for three reasons: the global burden of these communicable diseases remains enormous, disease control programmes have an integral and supporting role in developing health systems, and the health benefits of these control programmes go beyond the containment of specific infections. WHO's traditional role in promoting communicable disease control programmes must also adapt to new circumstances.

The IVM approach aims to contribute to achieving the global targets set for vector-borne disease control by making vector control more efficacious, cost-effective, ecologically sound and sustainable. This document addresses the use of IVM for two of the most important vector-borne diseases: malaria and lymphatic filariasis. The IVM approach is useful and appropriate for jointly managing control activities against malaria and lymphatic filariasis in terms of planning, implementation and monitoring, particularly in areas where both infections are transmitted by the same species of mosquito vectors. IVM may concurrently reduce the incidence of both diseases so that control efforts have synergistic effects. In this way, IVM enables resources to be used more efficiently to control multiple vector-borne diseases and thus they have a greater impact on public health than would be the case with control programmes aimed at a single disease.",2011,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,WHO/HTM/NTD/PCT/2011.2,4,http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/70817/WHO_HTM_NTD_2011.2_eng.pdf?sequence=1,Multicountry Global,1371,Open ,MDA,"NTD, WHO position statement, integrated Vector Management, malaria programe",English,,PacELF_1371 WHO 2011 Integrated vector management to control malaria and lymphatic filariasis.pdf

However, the efficiency of PCR amplification may vary between samples depending on the presence of PCR inhibitors, leading sometimes to false negative results. To overcome this drawback, an internal standard plasmid (pWB11) was constructed. It can be added to each PCR reaction for coamplification along with the target W. bancrofti DNA (Sspl DNA repeat) using the same pair of primers. PCR products from W. bancrofti DNA or from pWB11 are 34 bp different in size and can be visualized either on agarose gel or by DNA ELISA using two different oligonucleotides probes.",1997,"Nicolas, L., Plichart, C.",Parasite,,4(3),253-257,https://doi.org/10.1051/parasite/1997043253,French Polynesia,1403,Open,,"DNA,PCR,ELISA,",English,,PacELF_1403 Nicolas Plichart 1997 PARASITE PCR for Wb parasite1997043p253.pdf

The disease has been targeted for global elimination by 2020. Transmission control and disability alleviation are the two pillars of the elimination strategy under the Global Programme for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF). Interruption of transmission is being achieved by mass annual administration of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or ivermectin to entire communities at risk of infection. When community drug consumption rates are adequate, this is expected to result in reduction of transmission of lymphatic filariasis to low levels, and ultimately in elimination of filariasis, preventing new infections from occurring and protecting future generations from the disease. Recognizing the physical suffering, gross disfigurement and consequent socioeconomic impact due to lymphoedema (particularly limbs), and the fact that simple foot hygiene can result in prevention of repeated attacks of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL) and progression of lymphoedema, efforts are being taken to teach patients and their families skin care and simple measures of hygiene. It is realized that a disability alleviation strategy needs to be evolved for lymphatic filariasis patients who suffer from several urogenital manifestations, the burden of which is larger than that due to lymphoedema of limbs. In view of this, the WHO unit for Strategy Development and Monitoring for Eradication and Elimination (CEE) called for an informal consultation meeting of surgeons to address the issue of surgical management of urogenital manifestations of filariasis.",2002,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,WHO/CDS/CPE/CEE/2002.33,34,http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/67600/WHO_CDS_CPE_CEE_2002.33.pdf?sequence=1,Multicountry Global,1448,Open,Surgery,"surgical approach, urogenital manifestation, informal consultation, algorithm, classification",English; French,French version can be found at publishers site,PacELF_1448 Surgical approaches to the urogenital manifestations of lymphatic filariasis.pdf

Throughout this period, the need for standardized guidelines on monitoring and epidemiological assessment of the Programme at implementation unit level has become increasingly evident because this is the level at which the core programmatic operations are conducted. These guidelines are based on current knowledge and understanding of the epidemiological aspects of the disease. However, in view of the rapid involvement of both scientific advances and experience in implementation of national elimination programmes, adaptation of the guidelines might be required to address particular circumstances. In light of the diverse responsibilities of the health personnel in charge of lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes, the authors have developed guidelines that are as concise as possible. Annexes have been included to provide the most relevant technical background information while avoiding too much detail in the body of the guidelines. Similar guidelines are planned to assist health personnel at the level of the implementation unit in other areas such as drug distribution, social mobilization and disability prevention and control.",2005,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,,57,https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/69172,Multicountry Global,1460,Open,"MDA, blood survey, TAG, Mapping, Midterm","round 5 of MDA, questionnaire, stopping MDA",English,Also a hard copy JCU,PacELF_1460 WHO 2005 Monitoring and epidemiological assessment of the programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis at implementation level.pdf

1591,NGSK,1104,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,Periodicity of Wuchereria bancrofti var. pacifica filariasis in French Polynesia,"In 1992, a study on microfilaremia periodicity was carried out on 12 Wuchereria bancrofti carriers in the Marquesas islands. Blood samples were collected simultaneously every 4 hours during a 48 hour period by finger-prick and venipuncture for determination of microfilaremia by both blood film and membrane filtration technique methods, and for determination of antigenemia. The membrane filtration results showed no significant nycthemeral variations between the microfilaria densities at hours 16:00, 20: 00, 24:00, 04:00, 08:00 and 12:00. Conversely, the blood film method showed a significant difference between the microfilaria densities: the microfilaremia was higher during the day (12:00-20:00 hours) than during the night (24:00-08:00 hours). As for antigenemia, using Og 4 C3 monoclonal antibody, there was no significant fluctuation during 48 hours. These results confirm that W bancrofti var. pacifica is subperiodic and diurnal in French Polynesia. In particular, they substantiate the validity of examining venous blood by the membrane filtration technique as the judgment criterion of choice in therapeutic trials and of examining capillary blood during peak hours by the blood film method for evalauting the endemic level in a population.",1993,"Moulia-Pelat, J.P., Glaziou, P., Chanteau, S., Nguyen-Ngoc, L., Marcet, Y., Gardines, R., Martin, P.M.V., Cartel, J.L.",Tropical Medicine and Parasitology,,44(2),83-85,,French Polynesia,1591,Contact PacELF at JCU,blood survey,"antigen,",English,,
1592,NGSK,1395,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Electronic/Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,Strategies and tools for the control/elimination of lymphatic filariasis,"Lymphatic filariasis infects 120 million people in 73 countries worldwide and continues to be a worsening problem, especially in Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Elephantiasis, lymphoedema, and genital pathology afflict 44 million men, women and children; another 76 million have parasites in their blood and hidden internal damage to their lymphatic and renal systems. In the past, tools and strategies for the control of the condition were inadequate, but over the last 10 years dramatic research advances have led to new understanding about the severity and impact of the disease, new diagnostic and monitoring tools, and, most importantly, new treatment tools and control strategies. The new strategy aims both at transmission control through community-wide (mass) treatment programmes and at disease control through individual patient management. Annual single-dose coadministration of two drugs (ivermectin + diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or albendazole) reduces blood microfilariae by 99% for a full year; even a single dose of one drug (ivermectin or DEC) administered annually can result in 90% reductions; field studies confirm that such reduction of microfilarial loads and prevalence can interrupt transmission. New approaches to disease control, based on preventing bacterial superinfection, can now halt or even reverse the lymphoedema and elephantiasis sequelae of filarial infection. Recognizing these remarkable technical advances, the successes of recent control programmes, and the biological factors favouring elimination of this infection, the Fiftieth World Health Assembly recently called on WHO and its Member States to establish as a priority the global elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem.",1997,"Ottesen, E.A., Duke, B.O.L., Karam, M., Behbehani, K.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,,75(6),491-503,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2487030/,Multicountry Global,1592,Open,"MDA, blood survey,","diagnostic tool, monitoring tool, treatment tool, two drug treatment, control strategies",English,,PacELF_1592 Ottesen et al 1997 Strategies and tools for the control elimination of lymphatic filariasis.pdf

The overall prevalence rate was 4.5% by the NP method and 3.8% by the FP method. The average microfilarial prevalence in males was 2.3 times higher than in females, and the rate among males aged 30 years and over was as high as 20%. The positive cases were found to be concentrated in certain households. The median microfilarial density (MfD-50) for the whole of Samoa was 18.6 using 60-mm3 blkood samples (males, 21.4; females 14.2). While the MfD-50 of any village has a positive association with the microfilarial prevalence rate of that village, a relatively high MfD-50 was noticed among young people under 20 years of age together with low prevalence rates. The negative binomial distribution was fitted to the data on the distribution of microfilarial counts in Samoa and gave a better fit than the log-normal distribution. The data having been fitted to the negative binomial, the number of false negatives could be determined as 9% of the estimated number of positives in the survey population when the NP method was employed and about 25% with the FP method. Further studies revealed that 15.1% of the microfilaria carriers presented some clinical manifestation, the most common being an attack of filarial fever (13.1%). The average duration of a fever attack was 3.5 days and the total period with fever/person/year averaged 27.1 days.",1985,"Kimura, E., Penaia, L., Spears, G.F.S.",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,,63(5),869-880,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2536451/,Samoa,1636,Open  ,blood survey,"epidemiology, subperiodic, after treatment, DEC, unclepore filtration method, fingerprick method",English,,PacELF_1636 Kimura et al 1985 BULL WHO Epidemiology of LF in Samoa 8 years after DEC  bullwho00088-0053.pdf

Chromatographic reaction with serum or plasma shows a result within 5 minutes. When compared with 454 thick blood films (standard smear method) within the same study, the ICT Filariasis test had sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 96.37%, efficiency = 96.70%, predictive value positive (PVP) = 70.70%, predictive value negative (PVN) = 100%. Compared with 454 membrane filtration technic (MFT), the MFT had sensitivity = 95.10%, specificity = 99.50%, efficiency = 99.12%, PVP = 95.10%, PVN = 99,50%. When we compared capillary tube technic (CAP) with TBF, CAP showed sensitivity = 85.40%, specificity = 100%, efficiency = 98.68%, PVP = 100%, PVN = 98.60%. With the convenience, high sensitivity-efficiency, lack of cross-reactions, no night blood collection, single reagent and rapidity of the test, the ICT Filariasis test can be recommended for screening of Bancroftian filariasis, and is suitable for the confirmation of suspected cases in the field where microscopic diagnosis is not availble.",1999,"Phantana, S., Sensathein, S., Songtrus, J., Klagrathoke, S., Phongnin, K.",Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health,,30(1),47-51,,Multicountry Global ,1683,Contact PacELF at JCU,"blood survey,","Wuchereria bancrofti, ICT test, polyclonal, monoclonal, chromatographic reaction,",English,,

Development of an easy-touse, rapid-format diagnostic tool has facilitated precise location of infectious zones thus allowing quick intervention. Two new drugs, i.e., ivermectin and albendazole, have been shown to be highly effective in the management of microfilariasis due to Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori thus greatly expanding a therapeutic arsenal once limited to diethylcarbamazine. The current eradication strategy is designed to break the chain of transmission in populations exposed to the risk of infection by administering a single dose of two drugs yearly for five to six years. Combined treatment using albendazole plus ivermectin or albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine has resulted in near-zero microfilaremia levels for at least one year. Based on these new developments, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution calling on member states to work for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem. Thanks to the donation of albendazole and ivermectin by SmithKline Beecham and Merck & Co. respectively, the WHO has started a worldwide program and set up task force including a wide-range of actors in different fields for eradication of this disease affecting 120 million people.",2000,"Karam, M., Ottesen, E.",Medecine Tropicale,,60(3),291-296,,Multicountry Global,1687,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,French,,

Antigenemia was determined in 1322 persons by means of the Og4C3 antibody capture assay. Prevalence of antigenemia by village ranged from 61.7% to 98.2% and did not vary by sex. Antigen level increased with transmission potential among the 4 villages with measured transmission potential (r(2)=.945; P=.028). Antigenemia was associated positively with age in villages with the lowest annual transmission potentials (45 and 404 infective larvae/year; P<.001), but was distributed evenly across age groups in villages with increased transmission (1485 and 2518 infective larvae/year). These data suggest that children and adults have similar worm burdens in areas of high transmission, whereas worm burdens in areas of lower transmission increase with age.

Overview: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring disease that has a major social and economic impact in Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific and parts of the Americas. Until recently, little could be done to relieve the suffering and disability caused by this disease. Today, however, significant advances have been made in understanding both the disease and its control. A global coalition has been forged among many organizations, each with a different mandate but all having a common goal: to tackle the wide-ranging and complex process of science and practice that will result in the elimination of LF as a public health problem1 from the world. A strong start was made in 1997 when the World Health Assembly passed a resolution calling for ' ... the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem ... '. Following this, WHO, with support from organizations including donor countries, the World Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began developing a coalition to eliminate the disease. The following year the coalition was given a powerful boost when SmithKiine Beech am announced its commitment to form a unique private-sector/public-sector collaboration with WHO to support the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. The two organizations pledged to work together closely to undertake this massive international public health effort. Subsequently, Merck & Co., Inc. pledged to expand its ongoing Mectizan® Donation Program for onchocerciasis to cover treatment of lymphatic filariasis in all African countries where the two diseases occur together. Individually, none of these organizations can eliminate LF; but by working together, and working through the Ministries of Health in the endemic countries, we believe that it can be done. Not all partners will work in each country, but, together, we hope to develop partnerships that will cover all of the affected countries and ensure an extraordinarily positive impact on many millions of lives.",1999,WHO Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination (CPE/CEE/FIL) Control Prevention and Eradication,,World Health Organization,,64,,Multicountry Global,1738,Contact PacELF at JCU ,MDA,"partners,strategies, vector control, DEC, albendazole, Ivermectin, DEC-fortified salt, ",English,,PacELF_1738 Building partnerships for lymphatic filariasis.

The present reviewof available evidence from the literature suggests that: (1)in addition to being a microfilaricidal agent, DEC in conventional dosages effectively kills adult worms of these three parasites in many patients; (2) relatively high total dosages of DEC (including dosages considerably in excess of those currently recommended) generally give better long-term therapeutic results than lower dosages; (3) spaced doses of DEC (weekly or monthly) are more effective than the same total dosage given in consecutive daily doses; (4) chronic administration of low-dose DEC, as in medicated salt, can effectively control filariasis caused by Jv. bancrofti or B. malayi; and (5) rational determination of the DEC regimen ideal for the killing of adult filarial parasites awaits the development of assays capable of sensitively detecting the presence of living adult parasites.",1985,"Ottesen, E.A.",Reviews of Infectious Diseases,,7(3),341-356,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/clinids/7.3.341,Multicountry Global,1762,Contact PacELF at JCU,,"DEC, treatment, human",English,,PacELF_1762 Ottesen 1985 REV INF DIS Efficacy of DEC LF 4453627.pdf

The advantage of the assay is that the biotinylated PCR product is visualized following hybridization with specific probes which are immobilized on plate wells (microtiter plate hybridization). This method has been previously evaluated in a field study and was found to be sensitive and specific for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. In the current study, the microtiter plate hybridization PCR method was evaluated by using blood specimens from malaria patients. All of 36 cases of falciparum malaria, 26 of 27 cases of vivax malaria, all of 11 cases of ovale malaria, and 2 cases of malariae malaria were diagnosed species specifically by the PCR method. There were four smear-negative, PCR-positive cases that seemed to correspond to the convalescent stage of malaria. In contrast, 30 cases for which the diagnosis of malaria has been excluded on the basis of microscopy and clinical courses showed negative PCR results. By comparing parasite densities and PCR results following antimalarial treatment of some patients, it was revealed that the PCR results largely paralleled the parasite densities and that PCR could detect as few as 10 parasites per microliter of blood. We conclude that this PCR method is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of all four parasite species and can serve as a useful supplement to microscopy for the clinical management of malaria.",1995,"Kimura, M., Miyake, H., Kim, H.S., Tanabe, M., Arai, M., Kawai, S., Yamane, A., Wataya, Y.",Journal of Clinical Microbiology,,33(9),2342-2346,,Multicountry Global,1810,Contact PacELF at JCU,,"PCR, convalescent stage, malaria parasite, RNA, acute stage",English,,

A much better fit is obtained with a truncated negative-binomial distribution, the k exponent of which is estimated to 0.3. This value does not seem to be affected by the endemic level, by microfilaricide mass-treatments or by the blood-sample volume. This result has immediate practical interests: it facilitates a posteriori comparisons between surveys in which different volumes of blood were examined; and at a given density, it allows calculating the change in sensitivity (detection rate) as a function of a change in the volume of blood examined, thus allowing better a priori planning of surveys. The paper provides the formulae required to calculate k, or, given k, to calculate the expected numbers in the various density classes. It also provides nomograms giving estimates of the true mean M and of the detection rate TD, given any one of the three following observations, made on observed positives: the median Dmf. 50, the mean m, or the percentage P1 having only 1 mf. The effect of changing the volume of blood on the rate of detection can then be read easily from the nomogram.

1886,NGSK,1496,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,The Welcome Trust Lecture Infection and disease in lymphatic filariasis an immunological perspective,"The basic tenet of the immunological perspective of filarial disease is that differential immune responsiveness among individuals exposed to infection results in the different clinical manifestations that develop. The mechanisms involved in this differential responsiveness appear to reflect different T-cell cytokine response patterns. Asymptomatic patients with the clinically silent presentation of asymptomatic microfilaraemia who have been previously described as being ‘ immunosuppressed ’ with respect to their generating pro-inflammatory (Thl -type) immune responses to parasite antigen, are now recognized to be fully responsive to parasite antigen but to produce cytokines and mediators that have primarily anti-inflammatory (Th2-like) effects. Studies with immunodeficient mice have indicated the existence of two alternative pathways to the development of lymphatic pathology one dependent on the induction of inflammatory reactions by the host immune response, the other entirely independent of the immune system and reflecting the direct actions of the parasite or its products on the lymphatics. As histopathology of affected human lymphatics is consistent with this hypothesis, it may be that the lymphatic pathology seen normally in the amicrofilaraemic, highly immunoresponsive infected patients derives from inflammation induced by immune responses to parasite antigen, whereas the lymphatic pathology sometimes seen coexisting with the ‘ immunosuppressed ’ state of asymptomatic microfilaraemia actually reflects lymphatic damage that is not immunologically mediated. Though little information exists about the natural history of lymphatic filariasis, there is no evidence for an inevitable progression from one clinical form to another. Instead, there appears to be a definite plasticity in the response that depends on prior (? pre-natal) and current exposure to the parasite as well as on the immunomodulatory effects it induces. This plasticity does not appear to be complete, however, as there is no evidence that a chronically infected host who has developed strong pro-inflammatory immune responses can subsequently become sufficiently down-regulated to support an asymptomatic microfilaraemia type of infection. Another possible constraint to the plasticity of the clinical and immunological responses may be the genetic determination of certain unusual syndromes, such as tropical pulmonary eosinophilia or TPE, though this hypothesis remains to be proven.",1992,"Ottesen, E.A.",Parasitology,,104(S1),S71-S79,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182000075259,Multicountry Global,1886,Contact PacELF at JCU,,"immunological perspective, infection, disease,",English,,

Accordingly, we applied lymphangioscintigraphy to patients with filariasis and, for purposes of interpretation, compared the findings with those in patients with nonfilarial lymphedema. Methods: Thirty-three patients with classic symptoms or signs consistent with acute or chronic filariasis underwent lymphangioscintigraphy, and the findings were compared with those in five patients without lymphatic dysfunction and in 50 other patients with primary or secondary lymphedema without exposure to filariasis. Results: As in patients with nonfilarial lymphedema, seintigraphic abnormalities in the 33 patients with filariasis included delayed or absent tracer transport of the radiotracer (25 patients), tortuous and bizarre deep lymphatics (seven patients), dermal diffusion (15 patients), retrograde tracer flow (six patients), and faint or absent regional nodal visualization (14 patients). Even in patients with long-standing filarial lymphedema, peripheral trunks were often visualized (at least in part), and regional nodes and more central lymphatics sometimes filled after light exercise. In some of the latter patients, however, discrete lymphatic trunks were not detected. Conclusion: Lymphangioscintigraphy is a simple, safe, reliable, noninvasive method with which to examine the peripheral lymphatic system, including truncal and nodal abnormalities, in endemic populations with occult and overt lymphatic filariasis.",1993,"Witte, M.H., Jamal, S., Williams, W.H., Witte, C.L., Kumaraswami, V., McNeill, G.C., Case, T.C., Panicker, T.M.R.",Archives of Internal Medicine,,153(6),737-744,,Multicountry Global,1888,Contact PacELF at JCU,,"lymphangioscintigraphy, examine, lymphatic system, abnormalities, truncal, nodal",English,,

It is currently the drug of choice for human onchocerciasis and shows potent microfilaricidal activity against the other major filarial parasites of humans (Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Loa ba and Mansonella ozzardi) but not against M. perstans. Whether or not it also kills the adult-stage of these parasites is currently under study. Ivermectin also has excellent efficacy in both human strongyloidiasis and cutaneous larva migrans for which good alternative treatments have not been available; and it is as effective as currently available drugs against the intestinal nematodes Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and Enterobius vermicularis; against the human hookworms it shows only partial efficacy.

Recognition that the immune responses of most infected patients are 'contrainflammatory' suggests that their primary role is to contain or limit inflammation around the parasite, not promote it. Pathology appears to develop either in response to parasite products or when the host is unable to contain local inflammation - around dying microfilariae in the skin of onchocerciasis patients or in response to bacterial or fungal super-infection of tissues with compromised lymphatic function in patients with lymphatic filariasis. Therapeutic strategies to control morbidity associated with these infections are focused on decreasing both the parasite burden and the inflammatory burden caused by super-infecting microorganisms. Effective treatment of affected populations is now possible with single annual doses of ivermectin (onchocerciasis) or diethylcarbamazine with or without ivermectin (lymphatic filariasis).",1994,"Ottesen, E.A.",Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases,,7(5),550-558,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00001432-199410000-00006,Multicountry Global,1890,Contact PacELF at JCU,,"molecular tools, DEC, PCR, treatment, onchocerciasis, Loiasis",English,,

The contrasting strategies and objectives of the different programmes are compared, and the impact on transmission, clinical disease and public health assessed. The constraints on programme success are: (i) the absence of a macrofilaricide, which can be used in a public health context; (ii) the sustainability of high coverage of ivermectin over many years in onchocerciasis control; and (iii) the problem of treatment in areas where Loa loa (tropical eye worm) is co-endemic with onchocerciasis because of the rare severe adverse events. LF programmes are expanding rapidly in over 30 countries, where circa 60 million people received treatments in 2002. No serious adverse events have been associated with MDAs for LF elimination.

1895,NGSK,1507,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,Deforestation effects on vector-borne disease,"This review addresses changes in the ecology of vectors and epidemiology of vector-borne diseases which result from deforestation. Selected examples are considered from viral and parasitic infections (arboviruses, malaria, the leishmaniases, filariases, Chagas Disease and schistosomiasis) where disease patterns have been directly or indirectly influenced by loss of natural tropical forests. A wide range of activities have resulted in deforestation. These include colonisation and settlement, transmigrant programmes, logging, agricultural activities to provide for cash crops, mining, hydropower development and fuelwood collection. Each activity influences the prevalence, incidence and distribution of vector-borne disease. Three main regions are considered - South America, West & Central Africa and South-East Asia. In each, documented changes in vector ecology and behaviour and disease pattern have occurred. Such changes result from human activity at the forest interface and within the forest. They include both deforestation and reafforestation programmes. Deforestation, or activities associated with it, have produced new habitats for Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and have caused malaria epidemics in South America. The different species complexes in South-East Asia (A. dirus, A. minimus, A. balabacensis) have been affected in different ways by forest clearance with different impacts on malaria incidence. The ability of zoophilic vectors to adapt to human blood as an alternative source of food and to become associated with human dwellings (peridomestic behaviour) have influenced the distribution of the leishmaniases in South America. Certain species of sandflies (Lutzomyia intermedia, Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmam), which were originally zoophilic and sylvatic, have adapted to feeding on humans in peridomestic and even periurban situations. The changes in behaviour of reservoir hosts and the ability of pathogens to adapt to new reservoir hosts in the newly-created habitats also influence the patterns of disease. In anthroponotic infections, such as Plasmodium, Onchocerca and Wuchereria, changes in disease patterns and vector ecology may be more difficult to detect. Detailed knowledge of vector species and species complexes is needed in relation to changing climate associated with deforestation. The distributions of the Anopheles gambiae and Simulium damnosum species complexes in West Africa are examples. There have been detailed longitudinal studies of Anopheles gambiae populations in different ecological zones of West Africa. Studies on Simulium damnosum cytoforms (using chromosome identification methods) in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme were necessary to detect changes in distribution of species in relation to changed habitats. These examples underline the need for studies on the taxonomy of medically-important insects in parallel with long-term observations on changing habitats. In some circumstances, destruction of the forest has reduced or even removed disease transmission (e.g. S. neavei-transmitted Onchocerca in Kenya). Whilst the process of deforestation can be expected to continue, hopefully at a decreased rate, it is expected that unpredictable and sometimes rapid changes in disease patterns will pose problems for the public health services.",1993,"Walsh, J.F., Molyneux, D.H., Birley, M.H.",Parasitology,,106(S1),S55-S75,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182000086121,Multicountry Global,1895,Contact PacELF at JCU,,"arboviruses, changas disease, deforestation, filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, shistosomiasis, vectors, deforestation",English,,

1906,NGSK,1004,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Hardcopy,Action/Strategic Plans,Building Partnerships for Lymphatic Filariasis.,"Overview: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring disease that has a major social and economic impact in Asia, Africa, the Western Pacific and parts of the Americas. Until recently, little could be done to relieve the suffering and disability caused by this disease. Today, however, significant advances have been made in understanding both the disease and its control. A global coalition has been forged among many organizations, each with a different mandate but all having a common goal: to tackle the wide-ranging and complex process of science and practice that will result in the elimination of LF as a public health problem1 from the world. A strong start was made in 1997 when the World Health Assembly passed a resolution calling for ' ... the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem ... '. Following this, WHO, with support from organizations including donor countries, the World Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began developing a coalition to eliminate the disease. The following year the coalition was given a powerful boost when SmithKiine Beech am announced its commitment to form a unique private-sector/public-sector collaboration with WHO to support the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. The two organizations pledged to work together closely to undertake this massive international public health effort. Subsequently, Merck & Co., Inc. pledged to expand its ongoing Mectizan® Donation Program for onchocerciasis to cover treatment of lymphatic filariasis in all African countries where the two diseases occur together. Individually, none of these organizations can eliminate LF; but by working together, and working through the Ministries of Health in the endemic countries, we believe that it can be done. Not all partners will work in each country, but, together, we hope to develop partnerships that will cover all of the affected countries and ensure an extraordinarily positive impact on many millions of lives.",1999,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,,50,http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/66252/WHO_FIL_99.198.pdf?sequence=1,Multicountry Global,1906,Open,MDA,"strategic plan, vector control, partnership",English,3 hard copies exist with different PacELF IDs,PacELF_1906 WHO 1999 Building partnerships for lymphatic filariasis WHO_FIL_99.198.pdf

1951,NGSK,1607,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,Treatment strategies underpinning the global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis,"Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a disease targeted for elimination. The global strategy is a once-yearly, single-dose, two-drug regimen utilised by communities at risk for LF, with the goal of reaching 80% population coverage yearly, for at least 5 years, in order to interrupt transmission of LF. Where onchocerciasis is co-endemic, the regimen is ivermectin 200 - 400 μg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg; elsewhere, the regimen should be diethylcarbamazine 6 mg/kg plus albendazole 400 mg.

The final step in this algorithm is a survey of the prevalence of filarial antigenemia among school entrants using lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS). MDAs are stopped only if the survey demonstrates statistically that antigenemia prevalence is <0.1%. The guidelines for the LQAS survey are to select a systematic sample of 3000 school entrants and to conclude that MDAs can be stopped only if no child is among the 3000 is found to be antigenemic. In August 2008, a meeting convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) on when to stop MDAs made recommendations for changing the antigenemia survey guidelines in the 2005 manual.2 The recommendations are summarized below as well as the modifications of these recommendations agreed on in subsequent meetings.",2009,"Deming, M., Lee, H.",, ,,,,Multicountry Global ,1983,Contact PacELF at JCU,manual,"MDA, stopping MDA, manual, algorithm, LQAS, Ius",English,"Draft - June 12, 2009.

Laboratory studies showed that the new assay was highly sensitive in comparison with the standard dissection and microscopy technique. The assay can detect as little as 4 pg of parasite DNA or a single microfilaria in pools of up to 100 mosquitoes. The optimum pool size for convenience was found to be 50 mosquitoes per pool. The efficacy of PCR assay was evaluated in filariasis control programmes in operation in endemic areas of Kerala State, South India. The infection rates obtained by the Hha I PCR assay and the conventional dissection and microscopy technique were 1.2% and 1.7% respectively in operational areas and 8.3% and 4.4% respectively, in check areas, which were not significantly different (P < 0.05).

Therefore, in order to arrive at a simple procedure, four different methods (A, B, C and D) were tried for the extraction of DNA from mosquitoes infected with filarial parasite, Brugia malayi. Method D was found to be as efficient as the current procedure for the extraction of DNA from a single microfilaria in pools of 25 mosquitoes and the DNA was suitable for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, yielding a band of 322 base pairs with primers specific for B. malayi. Method D involved drying and crushing the mosquitoes to a powder, which was homogenized in 100 μl TE buffer, vortexed, boiled for 10 min, centrifuged at 14 000 r.p.m. for 10 min, and the supernatant used for the PCR assay. Dot-blot hybridization confirmed the specificity of the PCR amplified fragment. The DNA extracted by this method was stable for about 1 year. When comparing with the standard method, the cost of a single PCR reaction, inclusive of DNA extraction, was reduced by 50% and the hands on time was minimized fivefold. Hence, this simple TE-based method is rapid, safe and also cost-effective in assessing the B. malayi infection in pools of vector mosquitoes.",2001,"Vasuki, V., Patra, K.P., Hoti, S.L.",Acta Tropica,,79(3),245-248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0001-706X(01)00136-X,Multicountry Global,1991,Contact PacELF at JCU,TAS,"Brugia malayi, PCR, Hha 1, Extraction of parasite DNA, simplified method",English,,
1992,NGSK,1693,JCU WHOCC Ichimori,,Hardcopy,Scientific Papers,Inflammatory responses induced by the filarial nematode Brugia malayi are mediated by lipopolysaccharide-like activity from endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria,"The pathogenesis of filarial disease is characterized by acute and chronic inflammation. Inflammatory responses are thought to be generated by either the parasite, the immune response, or opportunistic infection. We show that soluble extracts of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi can induce potent inflammatory responses, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and nitric oxide (NO) from macrophages. The active component is heat stable, reacts positively in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, and can be inhibited by polymyxin B. TNF-α, IL-1β, and NO responses were not induced in macrophages from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-nonresponsive C3H/HeJ mice. The production of TNF-α after chemotherapy of microfilariae was also only detected in LPS-responsive C3H/HeN mice, suggesting that signaling through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is necessary for these responses. We also show that CD14 is required for optimal TNF-α responses at low concentrations. Together, these results suggest that extracts of B. malayi contain bacterial LPS. Extracts from the rodent filaria, Acanthocheilonema viteae, which is not infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria found in the majority of filarial parasites, failed to induce any inflammatory responses from macrophages, suggesting that the source of bacterial LPS in extracts of B. malayi is the Wolbachia endosymbiont. Wolbachia extracts derived from a mosquito cell line induced similar LPS-dependent TNF-α and NO responses from C3H/HeN macrophages, which were eliminated after tetracycline treatment of the bacteria. Thus, Wolbachia LPS may be one of the major mediators of inflammatory pathogenesis in filarial nematode disease.",2000,"Taylor, M.J., Cross, H.F., Bilo, K.",Journal of Experimental Medicine,,191(8),1429-1435,http://dx.doi.org/10.1084/jem.191.8.1429,Multicountry Global,1992,Contact PacELF at JCU,,"endotoxin, pathogenesis, symbiosis, lipopolysaccharide, Wolbachia",English,,

Microfilaria levels fell rapidly after ivermectin administration in all dosage groups and 98% of pretreatment microfilariae was cleared after 12 h of treatment. The rate of microfilaria (mf) clearance was slower with 20 μg/kg than with the highest dose (200 μg/kg) administered. Forty-six patients (77%) became amicrofilaraemic within 2 weeks of treatment. Side reactions were noted in 97% of cases. The most common reactions were fever, headache, weakness, myalgia and cough which appeared by 12 h and subsided by 72 h following treatment. The frequency and intensity of side reactions were related to pretreatment mf densities and were independent of the dose administered. Unusual side reactions were noted in a few patients with high density microfilaraemia. These included intense cough, shortness of breath, blood tinged mucoid expectoration associated with patchy pneumonitis of the lung. Itchy rashes, lymphatic nodules and raised alkaline phosphatase level were also observed in some patients. These side reactions were transient, self limiting and were not serious enough to warrant any treatment.

Antibiotic treatment of filarial nematodes results in sterility and inhibits larval development and adult worm viability. In the first trial on human onchocerciasis depletion of bacteria following treatment with doxycycline resulted in a complete and long-term block of embryogenesis. Bacteria are unable to repopulate nematode tissues up to 18 months after depletion, suggesting these effects may be permanent. Following ivermectin treatment, individuals given antibiotic therapy showed sustained reductions in skin microfilariae, with the majority of people remaining microfilarial negative 12 - 18 months after treatment.

The filarial nematodes that cause these diseases are transmitted by blood-feeding insects and produce chronic and long-term infection through suppression of host immunity. Disease pathogenesis is linked to host inflammation invoked by the death of the parasite, causing hydrocoele, lymphoedema, and elephantiasis in lymphatic filariasis, and skin disease and blindness in onchocerciasis. Most filarial species that infect people co-exist in mutualistic symbiosis with Wolbachia bacteria, which are essential for growth, development, and survival of their nematode hosts. These endosymbionts contribute to inflammatory disease pathogenesis and are a target for doxycycline therapy, which delivers macrofilaricidal activity, improves pathological outcomes, and is effective as monotherapy. Drugs to treat filariasis include diethylcarbamazine, ivermectin, and albendazole, which are used mostly in combination to reduce microfilariae in blood (lymphatic filariasis) and skin (onchocerciasis).

A total of 3,683 children aged 5-12 years attending 27 primary schools in 13 Pacific Island countries were surveyed along with school environmental data. Stool samples were collected from 1996 children (54.2%) and analysed for ova and helminths. Total prevalence of helminthiasis was 32.8%. Anaemia prevalence was 12.4%. Children with helminthiasis and anaemia were found to be 8.7 times more likely to be stunted and 4.3 times more likely to be underweight than non-anaemic and non-infected children. Four significant environmental influences on helminthiasis were identified: (1) an inadequate water supply; (2); availability of a school canteen; (3) regular water/sanitation maintenance regimes; and (4) overcrowded classrooms. Helminthiasis was found to be strongly associated with anaemia, stunting and underweight and environmental influences identified. Although mass anti-helminthic drug administrations (MDA) have been taking place, reinfection is common as drug therapy alone is not enough. Programme effectiveness depends upon upgrading school environments to include an adequate water supply, controlled food preparation/provision, well-maintained water/sanitation facilities and class sizes of 30 students or less.",2004,"Hughes, R.G., Sharp, D.S., Hughes, M.C., Akau'ola, S., Heinsbroek, P., Velayudhan, R., Schulz, D., Palmer, K., Cavalli-Sforza, T., Galea, G.",International Journal of Environmental Health Research 14,,14(3),163-177,,Multicountry Pacific,2106,Contact PacELF at JCU,,"Helminth, anemia, nutrition, school, children, water supply, sanitation, personal hygiene",English,,

Typically, they only appear in the human bloodstream at nighttime, synchronised with their mosquito vectors. In Polynesia and parts of Southeast Asia, free of nocturnal vectors, they are found at all hours, and each population biorhythm differs. Through a geometrical approach, we explain this circadian diversity by a single, dominant mutation: the clocks of individual parasites are set at midnight (ubiquitous) or at 2 p.m. Compared to other circadian genes, this mutation must be very old, as it is shared by four biologically remote genera of parasites. This seniority sheds new light on several theoretical and practical aspects of vector-parasite temporal relations.Hardcopy is a draft document",2004,"Pichon, G.

Ten plants in every patch of Pandanus plantation were sampled at each village. Among 23,049 mosquito larvae collected from Upolu, 77% were the filariasis vector Aedes (Finlaya) samoanus, 17.7% were Ae.(Fin.)oceanicus and 5.3% were Ac.(Fin.)tutuilae. Out of 6981 larvae taken in Savai'i, 23.2% were Ae.samoanus, 67.6% Ae.oceanicus and 9.2% Ae.tutuilae. When larval counts per plant were analysed for each district, Ae.samoanus was found to predominate in Pandanus in Upolu and Ae.oceanicus in Savai'i. However, the adult density of Ae.samoanus was higher in Savai'i and this was attributed to the large areas of forests with Freycinetia for Ae.samoanus breeding. In Pandanus in Savai'i the number of Ae.samoanus was negligible. In Upolu, with more urbanization and larger plantations, there was greater breeding of Ae.samoanus in Pandanus.

The mf rate was correlated with both infection and infective rates of Ae. polynesiensis in Upolu, but not of Ae. samoanus. In Upolu, Ae. polynesiensis was apparently the major vector. It was relatively more abundant in more cultivated and populated areas, along the northern coast of Upolu, except Apia town area. In Savaii, Ae. samoanus predominated over Ae. polynesiensis except in ""plantation"" villages. Relatively high biting densities and rates of infection and infectivity indicated that Ae. samoanus was not less important than Ae. polynesiensis as a vector in Savaii. Ae. samoanus preferred natural vegetation, in contrast to Ae. polynesiensis which was found near human habitations in cultivated land. There was no difference between the biting densities of Ae. polynesiensis in ""coastal"" and ""inland"" villages, indicating that crab holes (numerous only in some coastal villages) may not influence the density of Ae. polynesiensis. Higher mf rates were associated with villages where Ae. polynesiensis, rather than Ae. samoanus, was dominant, indicating that Ae. polynesiensis was generally a more efficient vector. In the former villages, the difference in mf rates between males and females was smaller than in the latter, probably reflecting a difference in biting habits of the vectors. Ae. polynesiensis infections were recorded in plantations over 2 km from any village, suggesting that both habitats were foci of transmission.",1987,"Samarawickrema, W.A., Kimura, E., Spears, G.F.S., Penaia, L., Sone, F., Paulson, G.S., Cummings, R.F.",Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,81(1),129-135,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0035-9203(87)90304-X,Samoa,2177,Open via Publisher,,"entomology, Aedes polynesiensis, Aedes samoanus, vector, efficient vector",English,,"PacELF_2177 Samarawickrema et al 1987 TRSTMH Distribution of vectors, ..

Four yr of post control entomologic evaluation has revealed that the infection rate has dropped from 8.35% to 0.61% (1/14 of pre control rate) in Aedes (Stegomyia) polynesiensis and 4.47% to 0.26% (1/17 of pre control rate) in Aedes (Finlaya) samoanus; and the infective rate has dropped from 2.95% to 0.070% (1.42 of pre control rate) in Ae. polynesiensis and 0.26% to 0 in Ae. samoanus. More reduction was observed in the infective rate than the infection rate, presumably because of a remarkable decrease in the number of filarial larvae in infected mosquitos. It is suggested that, for the entomologic evaluation of filariasis control, the infective rate should be preferred to the infection rate. Of the three infective Ae. polynesiensis detected after the campaign, one was found three mth after its completion and the other two at least 1 yr later.

No infective Ae. samoanus was found in these samples. 12-hour all-day catches in the 2 coastal villages confirmed active transmission by Ae. polynesiensis. 12-hour all-night catches in the same 2 villages recorded high transmission by Ae. samoanus although there was little evidence of local breeding. The annual transmission potential for Ae. polynesiensis and Ae. samoanus was high in one of the coastal villages and low in the otther.

The area of Guadalcanal plains has been known as the most malarious area of the Solomons. In spite of well executed DDT indoor spraying, malaria transmission was not interrupted. The causative factors responsible for this persisting transmission appeared to rest on three factors: refractoriness of Anopheles farauti to DDT spraying; the habit of people to stay outside late in the evening and a marked outdoor biting tendency of A. farauti. It was found that DDT indoor spraying alone had little impact on interruption of malaria transmission. This study conducted in early 1974 was planned to observe the change of mosquito population density in relation to the constriction of the river-mouth in north Guadalcanal in order to consider alternative means for malaria control. With the result of this study, one can assume, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that the improvement of the malaria situation in north Guadalcanal would be associated with steady flow of the river water by maintaining the river/stream-mouth in an open condition.",1986,"Paik, Y-H.",Japanese Jounral of Experimental Medicine,,57(1),47-52,,Solomon Islands,2206,Contact PacELF at JCU,,river mouth,English,,

Totals of 1250 An.punctulatus and 141 An.koliensis were collected, the latter being the largest number of this species ever caught at any locality in the Solomons. Bednets impregnated with permethrin 0.5 g/m2 were introduced in December 1986 to be used at night by all 190 villagers for protection against malaria vectors. Bioassay tests with An.punctulatus blood‐fed females exposed under nets for lOmin resulted in 100% mortality up to 50 weeks post‐impregnation. For An.punctulatus, the main vector species, the mean catch (indoors + outdoors) per man hour was 2.9 (range 0.7–13.2) before a cyclone on 19 May 1986, and, 0.66 (0.2‐2.7) after the cyclone. The vector survival rates were usually high before the cyclone, but erratically lower thereafter for An.punctulatus. An.koliensis disappeared after the cyclone. Both An.punctulatus and An.koliensis consistently showed higher rates of biting man indoors than outdoors and their diel biting cycle showed a peak around midnight. Outdoors, the parous proportion of An.punctulatus was twice the nulliparous, and nearly so indoors. Following intervention with permethrin‐treated bednets, the mean catch of An.punctulatus fell to 0.35 per man‐hour (monthly range 0–1.5). The Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection rate reduced from 10% pre‐intervention to zero in September 1987, 9 months after intervention, and then rose again. With re‐impregnation of bednets in November 1987, the P.falciparum infection rate was again reduced by March 1988.

One area was found to be free of infection while the other still had one positive case. The DDT residual spraying had caused a change in biting habits of A. farauti No. 1 allowing a greater density of mosquitoes to bite man at times when they had lower microfilaria densities. This difference was compared with the pre-spray density so that the maximum permissible number of mosquitoes biting man without transmission of filariasis taking place, could be calculated. A theoretical value for m of 19-84 had been worked out previously; this study gave a corrected observed value of m of approximately 20, very close to the calculated theoretical value. The situation studied here probably showed incomplete interruption of transmission, so it was considered preferable to recommend a figure of 0-66 average vector man-biting rate per hour indoors for the critical value.",1981,"Webber, R.H., Southgate, B.A.",Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,75(4),499-506,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0035-9203(81)90185-1,Solomon Islands,2214,Contact PacELF at JCU,vector control,"Anopheles, density, geographical, parasitological, entomological",English,,

Overview: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis targets the global elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public-health problem by 2020. The main strategy is to interrupt transmission through integrated preventive chemotherapy, using mass drug administration to treat entire populations at risk of the disease, with a combination of albendazole plus ivermectin or albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine administered as a single dose once a year for at least 5 years. Because ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine can cause serious adverse effects in people infected with Loa loa causing loiasis (African eye worm), an endemic disease in a large part of central Africa, the current guidelines for preventive chemotherapy contain no recommendation for areas where lymphatic filariasis and loiasis are co-endemic but where onchocerciasis is hypo-endemic or non-endemic. Consequently, mass drug administration to eliminate lymphatic filariasis using the combination of medicines recommended by the World Health Organization could thus far not be implemented in these communities. In order to meet the 2020 goal, it has become urgent to develop an alternative strategy for interrupting transmission of lymphatic filariasis adapted to the specific situation of co-endemicity with Loa loa. This strategy could potentially include both medication and vector control. The milestones for the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis 2010–2020 stipulate that by 2012, a provisional strategy for interrupting lymphatic filariasis transmission in loiasis-endemic countries should have been developed; and that by 2013, a revised strategy for interrupting lymphatic filariasis transmission should have been implemented in all loiasis-endemic countries. In June 2011, a preliminary meeting on Loa loa in Lusaka, Zambia, proposed the following provisional strategies for eliminating lymphatic filariasis in areas where Loa loa is co-endemic: integrated vector management as the main strategy, and mapping of lymphatic filariasis and Loa loa at the lowest possible administrative level to potentially identify small areas that can be treated for lymphatic filariasis.",2012,World Health Organization,,World Health Organization,WHO/HTM/NTD/PCT/2012.6,25,https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/75139,Multicountry Global,2767,Open via Publisher,"MDA, vector control, mapping","Oncho, Loiasis, Malaria, albendazole, ivermectin",English,,PacELF_2767 WHO 2012 Provisional strategy for interrupting lymphatic filariasis transmission in loiasis-endemic countries.pdf

The term xenomonitoring was introduced for this approach. The GPELF was launched in 2000, based on two strategies: stopping transmission and alleviation of disability due to the disease. Currently the GPELF depends largely on mass drug administration (MDA) to interrupt transmission of filaria parasites: Brugia and Wuchereria bancrofti.

Studies from 1967 to the present conducted in Brazil, Japan, Tanzania, India, China, and Taiwan involving administration of DEC salt for 18 days to 1 year, have shown this intervention to be effective for both bancroftian and brugian filariasis, as measured by reductions in both microfilarial density and positivity, and in some studies through reduction in mosquito positivity rates as well. Furthermore, studies suggest specific advantages from using DEC salt, including lack of side effects, particularly for bancroftian filariasis, and ability to reduce prevalence below 1 % when used in conjunction with standard regimens of DEC tablets. However, use of DEC salt as a control tool suffers from a concern that health authorities might find it difficult to manage a programme involving a commodity such as salt. In the past decade, the very successful global efforts to eliminate iodine deficiency through universal salt iodization have demonstrated that partnership with the salt industry can be both successful and effective as a public health tool. Use of DEC salt can be most successfully implemented in areas in which (a) there is adequate governmental support for its use and for elimination of filariasis, (b) filariasis-endemic areas are clearly defined, (c) political leaders, health officials and the salt industry agree that DEC salt is an appropriate intervention, (d) the salt industry is well-organized and has known distribution patterns, (e) a successful national salt iodization effort exists, (f) a monitoring system exists that ensures adequacy of salt iodine content during production and that can also measure household coverage, and (g) measurement of impact on transmission of LF with the new antigen or filarial DNA detection methods can be established. There are advantages and disadvantages of using DEC-fortified salt compared with other interventions for LF elimination programmes, but rather than being considered as a 'competing' intervention, DEC salt should be seen as an additional option. Indeed, it is likely that many countries will derive maximal benefit from the synergistic effects of combining different intervention strategies in their national programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.",2000,"Houston, R.",Parasitology,,121 (SUPPL.),S161-S173,,Multicountry GlobaL,2896,Contact PacELF at JCU,DEC,Cost benefit analysis,English,,

The WHO Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (WHO-FIL) needed a reliable supply of diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) of known acceptable quality at an affordable price, so in August 1999, it started the DEC Project. Today's standards required development of a modern stability-indicating assay method for DEC and for DEC tablet dissolution. ADD Advanced Drug Delivery Technologies (Switzerland) developed a high-pressure liquid chromatography assay, which was independently validated and is in the United States Pharmacopoeia 25 (2002). After a global search, the project found that almost all existing and potential DEC active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and tablet manufacturers are in low-income countries. The project constructed an audit team to conduct on-site audits to assess good manufacturing practices according to European Union standards. National/state inspectors accompany the audit team. The team prequalified one DEC API manufacturer and three DEC tablet manufacturers. The project plans to increase the number of prequalified DEC manufacturers. Now, WHO-FIL only purchases from prequalified manufacturers.

Yet there are robust, low-cost and effective public health interventions that can relieve that burden and enable people in poor settings to lead better lives. Preventive anthelminthic chemotherapy aims at using available anthelminthic drugs either alone or in combination as a public health tool for preventing morbidity due to more than one form of helminthiasis at once. The emphasis of preventive chemotherapy is therefore on the best, coordinated use of drugs rather than on specific forms of helminthiasis. The greatest challenge is to expand regular anthelminthic drug coverage as a public health intervention to reach all at risk of morbidity induced by helminth diseases. Working to achieve the objectives of a national programme for the control of Neglected Tropical Diseases by implementing preventive chemotherapy requires regular and careful monitoring of drug coverage. Without reliable information about drug coverage programme managers and their staff cannot monitor programme performance efficiently. Managers must know how many people in need of treatment recieved the treatment, when and where it was offered.

Result of TAS with its recommendations prompted implementation of a LF MDA in the NWU region in February 2015 with the hope of a maximum coverage especially in areas where positive ICTs were found. The village of Faleasiu with the highest number of ICT positive, had a MDA coverage of 91%. However this high coverage was compromised by the low coverage rates from other constituencies, thus the overall coverage of 72%. Complementing MDA were vector control awareness programs in terms of source reduction and promoting the use of mosquito nets at home. The Health Sector needs to find out why NWU continues to be a problem area despite several rounds of LF MDAs in the past.

3126,JCU,743,JCU WHOCC,,Electronic,Reports and Results,Lymphatic Filariasis Transmission Assessment Survey 2017 and Soil Transmitted Helminthes Survey. Final Report. ,"Executive Summary  There has been much effort by the Samoa government through its Ministry of Health to control Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) disease in the country. It has proven to be a very debilitating, disfiguring and stigmatized neglected tropical disease affecting Samoa. Since the early 1950s Samoa has collaborated with development partners such as WHO and later JICA, in this endeavour. Since 1999, a renewed regional effort with PacELF to push LF elimination, had seen several rounds of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) country-wide with at least eight MDAs implemented in Samoa itself.  
In accordance with surveillance methods recommended by WHO, the Ministry of Health carried out its first transmission assessment survey for LF in 2013. It discovered the North West Upolu (NWU) area, one of the three enumeration units (EU) in the country, continued transmission of LF microfilarial worms. Two further rounds of MDA were then implemented within this area alone, the first in February 2015 and the last one in April 2017.  
This year, Samoa implemented its second transmission assessment survey, to assess whether or not LF had been interrupted in the failed EU of NWU, which had received two MDAs and also whether there was recrudesence in Savaii and other parts of Upolu. Methodology for the survey was kept as similar as possible for comparisons. However, for antigenic testing, ICT cards were replaced with Filriasis Test Strips (FTS). The sampled population were those of grades one and two (six and seven year old) children from all primary schools around the country. As an added feature of the LF TAS survey this year it was agreed to implement alongside it, the Soil Transmitted Helminthic (STH) survey as an initial attempt to gather much needed data for the status of Helminthic infestation amongst the Samoan population. This used primary school children in grades three and four (ages 8 and 9 years) and it utilized the Kato Katz test to identify the different helminthes that may be present. 
Survey results for the 2017 LF TAS saw all Enumeration Units AUA + ROU; NWU and Savaii having rather significant recrudescence with LF prevalence rates of 1.43%; 6.79% and 5.25% respectively. Despite the difference in tests used and the slight drop in actual sampled number of the population used, LF prevalence rates were indeed profound and shows a definite rise in LF transmission continuing country-wide in Samoa. At this stage, there is much needed work to be done for the realization of LF elimination, in Samoa. 
Survey results for STH survey indicates infestation amongst school children, which however needs further detailed data which was missing in the current survey. Prevalence results cannot be calculated as a significant number of samples were not processed due to unforeseen difficulties with Laboratory staff availability. At best, this survey serves to indicate the need for better planning and perhaps a separation of these two surveys. It also highlighted Laboratory inadequacies for the processing of stool specimen, as an injunction for other significant Public Health infectious disease surveillance such as typhoid contact tracing. 
In effect, Public Health measures for control and elimination of LF as well as addressing other PH diseases of significance must be strengthened urgently and simultaneously.

Samoa has come a long way in trying to eliminate LF from the country in the form of country wide MDAs which first begun in 1962.  Since 1999, about eight rounds of MDAs with varying coverage rates had been completed in Samoa.  This year, Samoa would be assessing whether or not LF had been interrupted following the series of MDAs.  Using ICT cards, antigen prevalence would be assessed in the 3 regions of Samoa namely North West Upolu, Savaii and Rest of Upolu combined with Apia Urban Area.  To out rightly state that LF had been interrupted, children born after the MDAs would not be infected with LF if MDAs were effective.  Thus, in this Transmission Assessment Survey, children of all primary schools in grades 1 and 2 are targeted.  WHO argues that antigen prevalence of <0.5% would be too low to sustain transmission of LF in a country or region.  The result of the survey suggests that EU Savaii with a prevalence of 0.46% and EU Apia Urban Area and Rest of Upolu with a prevalence of 0.08% indicate interrupted LF transmission in these regions.  On the other hand, North West Upolu region which had been indicated in past prevalence surveys to be a problem area showed a prevalence rate of 1.49%.  As such, Samoa needs to consider conducting 2 more rounds of MDAs in the North West Upolu region and repeating the Transmission Assessment Survey after 2-3 years in Savaii and Apia Urban Area and Rest of Upolu to establish recrudescence. Simultaneously, Samoa needs to strengthen mosquito surveillance and control to address Lymphatic Filariasis as well as personal protection from mosquitoes.",2013,"Government of Samoa, National Disease Surveillance & International Health Regulations (IHR) Division ",,,,13,,Samoa,3128,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,English,,PacELF_3128 Government of Samoa Ministry of Health NDSIHR Division 2013 Lymphatic Filariasis TAS 2013 Final Report 23 July 2013.pdf

The reductions in microfilaraemia prevalence rates one year after treatment were, respectively, 32%, 11%, 14% and 32%. The reductions in microfilaraemia levels one year after treatment were, respectively, 96%, 80%, 82% and 95%. Stool specimens from 82 children aged 6 years were examined for intestinal nematodes just before and just after treatment. IVR 400 μg/kg significantly reduced the prevalence and intensity of trichiuriasis. The combination IVR+DEC is a powerful tool for the control of lymphatic filariasis. Further studies are required to determine the appropriate presentation of DEC (salt and/or tablets), the frequency of treatment, and the duration of the control programme necessary to eradicate this disease.",1995,"Moulia-Pelat, J.P., Nguyen L.N., Hascoet, H., Luquiaud, P., Nicolas, L.

Prior antibody tests have suffered from poor sensitivity and/or specificity or from a lack of standardization. We conducted a multicenter evaluation of a new commercial ELISA that detects IgG4 antibodies to the recombinant filarial antigen Bm14. Four laboratories tested a shared panel of coded serum or plasma samples that included 55 samples from people with microfilaremic Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia infections and 26 control samples. Qualitative results were identical in all four test sites. In addition, each laboratory tested samples from their own serum banks. The test detected antibodies in 32 of 36 samples (91%) from people with Brugian filariasis and in 96 of 98 samples (98%) from people with Bancroftian filariasis. Specificity testing showed that many serum or plasma samples from patients with other filarial infections such as onchocerciasis had positive antibody tests. Specificity was otherwise excellent, although 3 of 30 samples from patients with ascariasis and 4 of 51 with strongyloidiasis had positive antibody tests; it is likely that some or all of these people had previously lived in filariasis-endemic areas. Antibody test results obtained with eluates from blood dried on filter paper were similar to those obtained with plasma tested at the same dilution. This test may be helpful for diagnosing LF in patients with clinical signs of filariasis. It may also be a useful tool for use in LF endemic countries to monitor the progress of filariasis elimination programs and for post-MDA surveillance.",2011,"Weil, G.J., Curtis, K.C., Fischer, P.U., Won, K.Y., Lammie, P.J., Joseph, H., Melrose, W.D., Brattig, N.W.",Acta Tropica ,,120(Suppl.1),S19-S22,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X10000963?via%3Dihub ,Multicountry Global,3135,Open via Publisher,,,English,,PacELF_3135 Weil et al 2011 ACTA TROP Mulicenter evaluation of Bm-14 1-s2.0-S0001706X10000963-main.pdf

3155,JCU,771,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Defining the larval habitat: abiotic and biotic paramters associated with Anopheles farauti productivity,"Background: In the Solomon Island, the dominant malaria vector, Anopheles farauti, is highly anthropophagic and increasingly exophilic and early biting. While long-lasting insecticide-treated nets remain effective against An. farauti, supplemental vector control strategies will be needed to achieve malaria elimination. Presently, the only World Health Organization recommended supplemental vector control strategy is larval source management (LSM). Effective targeted larval source management requires understanding the associations between abiotic, chemical and biological parameters of larval habitats with the presence or density of vector larvae. 
Methods: Potential and actual An. farauti larval habitats were characterized for presence and density of larvae and associated abiotic, chemical and biological parameters.
Results: A third of all sampled potential habitats harboured An. farauti larvae with 80% of An. farauti positive habitats being in three habitat classifications (swamps/lagoons, transient pools and man-made holes). Large swamps were the most abundant positive habitats surveyed (43% of all An. farauti positive habitats). Habitats with An. farauti larvae were significantly associated with abiotic (pH, nitrate, ammonia and phosphate concentrations and elevated temperature) and biotic (predators) parameters.
Conclusion: Large swamps and lagoons are the largest and most abundant An. farauti habitats in the Solomon Islands. Positive habitats were more frequently associated with the presence of predators (vertebrates and invertebrates) and higher water temperatures. Cohabitation with predators is indicative of a complex habitat ecosystem and raises questions about the potential of biological control as an effective control strategy. Increased presence of An. farauti with higher water temperature suggests a potential explanation for the coastal distribution of this species which is not found inland at elevated altitudes where temperatures would be cooler.",2019,"Mclaughlin, K., Burkot, T.R., Oscar, J., Beebe, N.W., Russell, T.L.",Malaria Journal ,,18(1),416,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-019-3049-7,Solomon Islands,3155,Contact PacELF at JCU,Anopheles farauti; Anopheles hinesorum; Anopheles lungae; Density; Elimination; Malaria; Receptivity; Solomon Islands; Wing length,,English,,PacELF_3155 McLaughlin et al 2019 Mar J Defining the larval habitat_abiotic and biotic paramters associated with Anopheles farauti productivity.pdf

Aedes polynesiensis is the main mosquito vector described in this territory. Other Aedes species have been reported, but recent entomological data are missing to infer the presence of other potential arbovirus vectors and to assess the entomological risk factors for transmission of arboviral diseases.
An entomological prospective study was conducted on the three main islands of the territory to determine the presence and distribution of Aedes spp. Larvae, pupae and adult mosquitoes were collected from 54 sampling points in different environments, with a final sampling of 3747 immature stages and 606 adults. The main identified breeding sites were described. Ae. polynesiensis was found in every sampled site in peridomestic and wild habitats. Ae. aegypti was only found on the island of Wallis in peridomestic environments with a limited distribution. Two other Aedes species endemic to the Pacific were recorded, Aedes oceanicus and Aedes futunae. To evaluate the ability of local Ae. polynesiensis to transmit the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), two field populations were analyzed for vector competence using experimental oral exposure of females to CHIKV and infection, dissemination and transmission assays. Results showed that both populations of Ae. polynesiensis were competent for CHIKV (30% at 7 days post-infection).
This study showed the ubiquitous distribution and abundance of Ae. polynesiensis on the three islands and demonstrated that local populations were able to transmit CHIKV. Combined with the presence and expansion of Ae. aegypti on the main island of Wallis, these data highlight the risk of transmission of arboviral diseases in the territory of Wallis and Futuna and provide relevant information for entomological surveillance and vector control programs.",2020,"Calvez, E., Pocquet, N., Malau, A., Kilama, S., Taugamoa, A., Labrousse, D., et al",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,,14(5),e0008250,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008250,Wallis and Futuna,3159,Contact PacELF at JCU,Arboviruses,,English,,PacELF_3159 Calvez et al 2020 Assessing entomological risk factors for arboviral disease transmission in the French Territory of the Wallis and Futuna Islands.pdf

As the number of mff ingested increases, the yield of L3 per microfi laria may either increase (in a process known as ‘facilitation’) or decrease (in a process known as ‘limitation’). Each ingested micro. laria that is successful (in terms of reaching the haemocoel) increases (facilitation) or decreases (limitation) the ‘permeability’ of the stomach wall for the next microfilaria.

Limitation is seen in some culicine mosquitoes, especially the Aedes spp. that transmit Wuchereria bancrofti, which, in consequence, become relatively more effcient as vectors as they ingest fewer mff. This phenomenon makes the interruption of filarial transmission by Aedes spp. particularly difficult. As the survival of anopheline mosquitoes is adversely affected by filarial infection, the use of mass drug administrations (MDA) to reduce the prevalence and intensity of microfilaraemias may increase the mean lifespan of some of the local Anopheles species. If these same species also act as vectors of malarial parasites, effective, drug-based control of W. bancrofti may worsen the problem posed by malaria. Therefore, wherever malaria and bancroftian filariasis are co-endemic and caused by parasites transmitted by the same species of mosquito, MDA should be augmented by interventions (use of bednets or house-spraying) against adult Anopheles.",2002,"Pichon, G.",Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology,,2,S1-S152,,Multicountry Global,3170,Contact PacELF at JCU,,,English,,PacELF_3170 Pichon 2002 ATMP Limitation facilitation LF.pdf

Recently, 2 closely related species of the Aedes (Stegomyia) scutellaris group were received from the Fiji Islands. One was Aedes (Stegomyia) pseudoscutellaris (Theobald) and the other was Aedes (Stegomyia) polynesiensis Marks. Both species were collected as females biting man and as males resting, landing, and swarming in the Suva area, Viti Levu Island, Fiji Islands, which is the type locality of pseudoscutellaris. Unfortunately, they are extremely similar and very difficult to separate. The recent report by Rakai et ale (1970) on biting times of polynesiensis and pseudoscutellaris on Viti Levu, the main island in Fiji, indicated that both species were primarily day-time biters and the numbers of the 2 species caught were 827 for polynesiensis and 1,840 for pseudoscutellaris.

3179,JCU,795,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Influence of environmental factors on the abundance of Anopheles farauti larvae in large brackish water streams in Northern Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands","Background
The main vector of malaria in Solomon Islands is Anopheles farauti, which has a mainly coastal distribution. In Northern Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, high densities of An. farauti are supported by large brackish streams, which in the dry season are dammed by localized sand migration. The factors controlling the high larval productivity of these breeding sites have not been identified. Accordingly the influence of environmental factors on the presence and density of An. farauti larvae was assessed in three large naturally dammed streams.

Methods
Larval sites were mapped and anopheline larvae were collected monthly for 12 months (July 2007 to June 2008) from three streams using standard dippers. Larval collections were made from 10 locations spaced at 50 m intervals along the edge of each stream starting from the coast. At each collection point, floating filamentous algae, aquatic emergent plants, sun exposure, and salinity were measured. These environmental parameters along with rainfall were correlated with larval presence and density.

Results
The presence and abundance of An. farauti larvae varied between streams and was influenced by the month of collection, and distance from the ocean (p < 0.001). Larvae were more frequently present and more abundant within 50 m of the ocean during the dry season when the streams were dammed. The presence and density of larvae were positively associated with aquatic emergent plants (presence: p = 0.049; density: p = 0.001). Although filamentous algae did not influence the presence of larvae, this factor did significantly influence the density of larvae (p < 0.001). Rainfall for the month prior to sampling was negatively associated with both larval presence and abundance (p < 0.001), as high rainfall flushed larvae from the streams. Salinity significantly influenced both the presence (p = 0.002) and density (p = 0.014) of larvae, with larvae being most present and abundant in brackish water at < 10‰ seawater.

Conclusion
This study has demonstrated that the presence and abundance An. farauti larvae are influenced by environmental factors within the large streams. Understanding these parameters will allow for targeted cost effective implementation of source reduction and larviciding to support the frontline malaria control measures i.e. indoor residual spraying (IRS) and distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs).",2011,"Bugoro, H., Hii, J., Russell, T.L., Cooper, R.D., Chan, B.K., Iro'ofa, C., Butafa, C., Apairamo, A., Bobogare, A. and Chen, C.C.,",Malaria Journal ,,10(1),1-11,http://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-10-262,Solomon Islands,3179,Open,"Indoor residual spray, Solomon Islands, Larval density, Filamentous Alga, larval control",,English,,"PacELF_3179 Bugoro 2011 Mal J Influence of environmental factors on the abundance of Anopheles farauti larvae in large brackish water streams in Northern Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands.pdf"

No arboviruses were isolated from over 200,000 mosquitoes, 9000 ticks, or 575 serum samples. Eight thousand human and 1117 bird, bat and animal sera were tested for haemagglutination-inhibiting arbovirus antibody using a variety of group A, group B and Bunyamwera group antigens. Only a small number of low-titre reactions were found among the non-human sera, but 14% of all human sera were found to contain Group B antibody. The antibody prevalence increased with increasing age, from less than 1 % for persons born since 1950, to 70% for persons born before 1900. The age differences in prevalence could be used to estimate the time and size of previous epidemics. Differences were found in antibody prevalence between the sexes, between ethnic groups and between persons from different regions. These differences could be explained in terms of climate, location and custom. Historical and serological evidence both suggest that all the antibody detected was due to past exposure to dengue virus. The very high proportion of the population with no dengue antibody makes Fiji a high-risk area for a further dengue epidemic.

The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends height or age-based dosing as alternatives to weight-based dosing for mass drug administration lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination programs. The goals of our study were to compare these alternative dosing strategies to weight-based dosing and to develop and evaluate new height-based dosing pole scenarios. Methodology/Principal findings. Age, height and weight data were collected from >26,000 individuals in five countries during a cluster randomized LF clinical trial. Weight-based dosing for diethylcarbamazine (DEC; 6 mg/kg) and ivermectin (IVM; 200 ug/kg) with tablet numbers derived from a table of weight intervals was treated as the “gold standard” for this study. Following WHO recommended age-based dosing of DEC and height-based dosing of IVM would have resulted in 32% and 27% of individuals receiving treatment doses below those recommended by weight-based dosing for DEC and IVM, respectively. Underdosing would have been especially common in adult males, who tend to have the highest LF prevalence in many endemic areas. We used a 3-step modeling approach to develop and evaluate new dosing pole cutoffs. First, we analyzed the clinical trial data using quantile regression to predict weight from height. We then used weight predictions to develop new dosing pole cutoff values. Finally, we compared different dosing pole cutoffs and age and height-based WHO dosing recommendations to weight-based dosing. We considered hundreds of scenarios including country- and sex-specific dosing poles. A simple dosing pole with a 6-tablet maximum for both DEC and IVM reduced the underdosing rate by 30% and 21%, respectively, and was nearly as effective as more complex pole combinations for reducing underdosing. Conclusions/Significance.

3209,JCU,825,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Detecting and confirming residual hotspots of lymphatic filariasis transmission in American Samoa 8 years after stopping mass drug administration,"The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) aims to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020 by conducting mass drug administration (MDA) and controlling morbidity. Once elimination targets have been reached, surveillance is critical for ensuring that programmatic gains are sustained, and challenges include timely identification of residual areas of transmission. WHO guidelines encourage cost-efficient surveillance, such as integration with other population-based surveys. In American Samoa, where LF is caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, and Aedes polynesiensis is the main vector, the LF elimination program has made significant progress. Seven rounds of MDA (albendazole and diethycarbamazine) were completed from 2000 to 2006, and Transmission Assessment Surveys were passed in 2010/2011 and 2015. However, a seroprevalence study using an adult serum bank collected in 2010 detected two potential residual foci of transmission, with Og4C3 antigen (Ag) prevalence of 30.8% and 15.6%. We conducted a follow up study in 2014 to verify if transmission was truly occurring by comparing seroprevalence between residents of suspected hotspots and residents of other villages. In adults from non-hotspot villages (N = 602), seroprevalence of Ag (ICT or Og4C3), Bm14 antibody (Ab) and Wb123 Ab were 1.2% (95% CI 0.6–2.6%), 9.6% (95% CI 7.5%-12.3%), and 10.5% (95% CI 7.6–14.3%), respectively. Comparatively, adult residents of Fagali’i (N = 38) had significantly higher seroprevalence of Ag (26.9%, 95% CI 17.3–39.4%), Bm14 Ab (43.4%, 95% CI 32.4–55.0%), and Wb123 Ab 55.2% (95% CI 39.6–69.8%). Adult residents of Ili’ili/Vaitogi/Futiga (N = 113) also had higher prevalence of Ag and Ab, but differences were not statistically significant. The presence of transmission was demonstrated by 1.1% Ag prevalence (95% CI 0.2% to 3.1%) in 283 children aged 7–13 years who lived in one of the suspected hotspots; and microfilaraemia in four individuals, all of whom lived in the suspected hotspots, including a 9 year old child. Our results provide field evidence that integrating LF surveillance with other surveys is effective and feasible for identifying potential hotspots, and conducting surveillance at worksites provides an efficient method of sampling large populations of adults.",2017,"Lau, C.L., Sheridan, S., Ryan, S., Roineau, M., Andreosso, A., Fuimaono, S., Tufa, J., Graves, P.M.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,,11(9),e0005914.,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005914 ,American Samoa,3209,Open,,,English,,PacELF_3209 Lau et al 2017 PLOS NTD Residual transmission hotspots in AS journal.pntd.0005914 (2).pdf

Filariasis in northern Fiji: epidemiological evidence regarding factors influencing the prevalence of microfilaraemia of Wuchereria bancrofti infections,"A survey of microfilaraemia among the population of Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Koro islands in northern Fiji was conducted in 1968 and 1969 as a prelude to a campaign of mass treatment with diethylcarbamazine.The prevalences of microfilaraemia were found in the more moist conditions of Taveuni and Koro and on the windward southern side of Vanua Levu to be higher than on the drier northern side of Vanua Levu. On both sides of Vanua Levu prevalences were lower inland than near the coast.Under apparently similar environmental conditions those of Fijian ethnic origin exhibited a higher prevalence of microfilaraemia than that shown by Indians. This ethnic difference and a difference between the prevalences in male and female Fijians are considered to be due more to higher rates of recovery from microfilaraemia in Indians and Fijian women than to diminished exposure to mosquitoes. Mathematical models have been used as an aid to the interpretation of the data, and, where appropriate, comparison has been made with the prevalence of antibodies to dengue, an arbovirus having the same vectors.Household infections were analysed by computer techniques. Infections in large households were not proportionately higher than in small households, indicating that transmission was not intrafamilial. The clustering of infections within households, though present, was not marked. Among the occupants of outlying settlements the prevalence of microfilaraemia was relatively low indicating a lower risk of infection due to isolation.",1971,"Mataika, J.U., Dando, B.C., Spears, G.F.S., Macnamara, F.N.",Jounral of Hygiene,,69,273,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022172400021501,Fiji,3210,Open via Publisher,,,English,,PacELF_3210 Mataika et al 1971 J Hyg Mosquito borne infections in Fiji 1 jhyg00088-0115.pdf

It is concluded that there is little evidence that mosquitoes make purposeful long distance flights that can be classified zoologically as migration.

3216,JCU,832,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Identifying residual transmission of lymphatic filariasis after mass drug administration: Comparing school-based versus community-based surveillance - American Samoa, 2016","Introduction. Under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) from 2000–2006. The World Health Organization recommends systematic post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of recent LF transmission. We compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-MDA surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6–7 years, and a community-based survey targeting people aged ≥8 years. Methods. In 2016, we conducted a systematic school-based TAS in all elementary schools (N = 29) and a cluster survey in 28 villages on the two main islands of American Samoa. We collected information on demographics and risk factors for infection using electronic questionnaires, and recorded geo-locations of schools and households. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using the Alere Filariasis Test Strip. For those who tested positive, we prepared slides for microscopic examination of microfilaria and provided treatment. Descriptive statistics were performed for questionnaire variables. Data were weighted and adjusted to account for sampling design and sex for both surveys, and for age in the community survey. Results. The school-based TAS (n = 1143) identified nine antigen-positive children and found an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3–1.8). Of the nine positive children, we identified one microfilariaemic 7-year-old child. The community-based survey (n = 2507, 711 households) identified 102 antigen-positive people, and estimated an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2% (95% CI: 4.5–8.6). Adjusted village-level prevalence ranged from 0–47.1%. CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. Of 86 antigen-positive community members from whom slides were prepared, 22 (25.6%) were microfilaraemic. School-based TAS had limited sensitivity (range 0–23.8%) and negative predictive value (range 25–83.3%) but had high specificity (range 83.3–100%) and positive predictive value (range 0–100%) for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. Conclusions. American Samoa failed the school-based TAS in 2016, and the community-based survey identified higher than expected numbers of antigen-positive people. School-based TAS was logistically simpler and enabled sampling of a larger proportion of the target population, but the results did not provide a good indication of the overall CFA prevalence in older age groups and was not sensitive at identifying foci of ongoing transmission. The community-based survey, although operationally more challenging, identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages, and foci of high antigen prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudescence of LF transmission.",2018,"Sheel, M., Sheridan, S., Gass, K., Won, K., Fuimaono, S., Kirk, M., Gonzales, A., Hedtke, S.M., Graves, P.M., Lau, C.L.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,,12(7),e0006583,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006583,American Samoa,3216,Open,,"albendazole; circulating filarial antigen; diethylcarbamazine; parasite antigen; unclassified drug; antifilarial agent; parasite antigen; adolescent; adult; age; aged; American Samoa; Article; blood sampling; child; drug administration; female; follow up; gender; Giemsa stain; health survey; human; lymphatic filariasis; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; predictive value; prevalence; questionnaire; school child; sensitivity and specificity; animal; blood; comparative study; demography; drug effect; isolation and purification; lymphatic filariasis; mass drug administration; parasitology; physiology; rural population; school; statistics and numerical data; transmission; Wuchereria bancrofti; Adolescent; American Samoa; Animals; Antigens, Helminth; Child; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Female; Filaricides; Humans; Male; Mass Drug Administration; Prevalence; Residence Characteristics; Rural Population; Schools; Wuchereria bancrofti",English,,PacELF_3216 Sheel et al 2018 PLOS NTDs Identifying residual transmission filariasis school and community surveys American Samoa journal.pntd.0006583.pdf
3217,JCU,834,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Rapid Wuchereria bancrofti-specific antigen Wb123-based IgG4 immunoassays as tools for surveillance following mass drug administration programs on lymphatic filariasis,"The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis has an urgent need for rapid assays to detect ongoing transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF) following multiple rounds of mass drug administration (MDA). Current WHO guidelines support using the antigen card immunochromatographic test (ICT), which detects active filarial infection but does not detect early exposure to LF. Recent studies found that antibody-based assays better serve this function. In the present study, two tests, a rapid IgG4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a lateral-flow strip immunoassay, were developed based on the highly sensitive and specific Wuchereria bancrofti antigen Wb123. A comparison of W. bancrofti-infected and -uninfected patients (with or without other helminth infections) demonstrated that both tests had high sensitivities and specificities (93 and 97% [ELISA] and 92 and 96% [strips], respectively). When the W. bancrofti-uninfected group was separated into those with other filarial/helminth infections (i.e., onchocerciasis, loiasis, and strongyloidiasis) and those who were parasite uninfected, the specificities of the assays varied between 91 and 100%. In addition, the geometric mean response by ELISA of W. bancrofti-infected patients was significantly higher than the response of those without W. bancrofti infection (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, the Wb123 ELISA and the lateral-flow strips had high positive and negative predictive values, giving valuable information on the size of survey population needed to be reasonably certain whether or not transmission is ongoing. These highly sensitive and specific IgG4 tests to the W. bancrofti Wb123 protein give every indication that they will serve as useful tools for post-MDA monitoring.",2013,"Steel, C., Golden, A., Kubofcik, J., LaRue, N., de Los Santos, T., Domingo, G.J., Nutman, T.B.",Clinical and Vaccine Immunology,,20(8),1155-1161,https://doi.org/10.1128/CVI.00252-13,Multicountry Global,3217,Open via Publisher,,,English,,PacELF_3217 Steel et al 2013 CLIN EXP IMMUNOL Rapid Wb123 assays zcd1155.pdf

This study seeks to quantify the relationship between microfilaria (Mf) density in human blood and the number of third stage (L3) larvae developing in the mosquito vectors Aedes polynesiensis Marks and Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) after blood-feeding. Two types of curves are fitted to previously published data. Fitting a linearized power curve through the data allows for correction for measurement error in human Mf counts. Ignoring measurement error leads to overestimation of the strength of density dependence; the degree of overestimation depends on the accuracy of measurement of Mf density. For use in mathematical models of transmission of lymphatic filariasis, a hyperbolic saturating function is preferable. This curve explicitly estimates the Mf uptake and development at lowest Mf densities and the average maximum number of L3 that can develop in mosquitoes. This maximum was estimated at 23 and 4 for Ae. polynesiensis and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively.",2004,"Stolk, W.A.,van Oortmarssen, G.J., Subramaniam, S., Das, P.K., Borsboom, G.J.J.M., Habbema, J.D.F., de Vlas, S.J.",Medical and Veterinary Entomology,,18,57-60,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0269-283X.2004.0470.x,French Polynesia,3218,Open via Publisher,,,English,,PacELF_3218 Stolk et al 2004 Density dependence in bancrofti in the vector Med Vet Ent.pdf

3220,JCU,837,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Demographic, socioeconomic and disease knowledge factors, but not population mobility, associated with lymphatic filariasis infection in adult workers in American Samoa in 2014","Background: Prevalence of lymphatic filariasis (LF) antigen in American Samoa was 16.5% in 1999. Seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) programmes between 2000 and 2006 reduced antigen prevalence to 2.3%. The most efficient methods of surveillance after MDA are not clear, but testing specific at-risk groups such as adults may provide earlier warning of resurgence. The role of migration from LF endemic countries in maintaining transmission also needs investigation. Few studies have investigated knowledge about LF and how that relates to infection risk. This study aims to investigate associations between socio-demographics, population mobility, disease knowledge and LF infection risk. Methods: In 2014, we surveyed 670 adults aged 16-68 years (62% female) at two worksites in American Samoa. Sera were tested for LF antigen and antibodies (Bm14 and Wb123) by rapid test and/or ELISA. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess association between seromarkers and demographic factors, household socioeconomic status (SES), residence, travel history, and knowledge of LF. Results: Overall, 1.8% of participants were positive for antigen, 11.8% for Bm14, 11.3% for Wb123 and 17.3% for at least one antibody. Recent travel outside American Samoa was not associated with positivity for any seromarker. Men had higher seroprevalence than women for all outcomes (any antibody: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.49 (95% CI: 2.21-5.49). Those aged over 35 years (compared to 15-24 years) had higher prevalence of Bm14 antibody (aOR = 3.75, 3.76 and 4.17 for ages 35-44, 45-54 and ≥ 55 years, respectively, P < 0.05). Lower SES was associated with seropositivity (antigen: aOR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.09-7.69; either antibody: aOR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.12-2.05). Those who knew that mosquitoes transmitted LF had lower Wb123 antibody prevalence (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.32-0.95). Conclusions: Opportunistic sampling of adults at worksites provided an efficient and representative way to assess prevalence and risk factors for LF in American Samoa and in hindsight, foreshadowed the resurgence of transmission. Risk of LF infection, detected by one or more serological markers, was not related to recent travel history, but was strongly associated with male gender, older age, lower SES, and lack of knowledge about mosquito transmission.

In certain settings the addition of ivermectin to this combination (IDA) remains a safe strategy and is more efficacious. However, the safety has yet to be described in scabies and soil-transmitted helminth endemic settings like Fiji. Villages of Rotuma and Gau islands were randomised to either DA or IDA. Residents received weight-based treatment unblinded with standard exclusions. Participants were actively found and asked by a nurse about their health daily for the first two days and then asked to seek review for the next five days if unwell. Anyone with severe symptoms were reviewed by a doctor and any serious adverse event was reported to the Medical Monitor and Data Safety Monitoring Board. Of 3612 enrolled and eligible participants, 1216 were randomised to DA and 2396 to IDA. Age and sex in both groups were representative of the population. Over 99% (3598) of participants completed 7 days follow-up. Adverse events were reported by 600 participants (16.7%), distributed equally between treatment groups, with most graded as mild (93.2%). There were three serious adverse events, all judged not attributable to treatment by an independent medical monitor. Fatigue was the most common symptom reported by 8.5%, with headache, dizziness, nausea and arthralgia being the next four most common symptoms. Adverse events were more likely in participants with microfilaremia (43.2% versus 15.7%), but adverse event frequency was not related to the presence of scabies or soil-transmitted helminth infection. IDA has comparable safety to DA with the same frequency of adverse events experienced following community mass drug administration. The presence of co-endemic infections did not increase adverse events. IDA can be used in community pro-grams where preventative chemotherapy is needed for control of lymphatic filariasis and other neglected tropical diseases. © 2020 Hardy et al.",2020,"Hardy, M., Samuela, J., Kama, M., Tuicakau, M., Romani, L., Whitfeld, M.J., King, C.L., Weil, G.J., Grobler, A.C., Robinson, L.J., Kaldor, J.M., Steer, A.C.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,,14(3),e0008106,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008106,Fiji,3222,Open,,"albendazole; diethylcarbamazine; ivermectin; albendazole; antiparasitic agent; diethylcarbamazine; insecticide; ivermectin; abdominal distension; abdominal pain; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; blood smear; child; controlled study; daily life activity; diarrhea; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; fatigue; feces analysis; female; follow up; headache; human; life threat; lymphatic filariasis; male; mass drug administration; microscopy; muscle weakness; myalgia; nausea; parasitology; prevalence; pruritus; randomized controlled trial; rash; scabies; treatment outcome; tropical disease; vomiting; adverse drug reaction; adverse event; combination drug therapy; community acquired infection; Fiji; helminthiasis; infant; lymphatic filariasis; middle aged; neglected disease; pathology; preschool child; procedures; rural population; scabies; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Albendazole; Antiparasitic Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Community-Acquired Infections; Diethylcarbamazine; Drug Therapy, Combination; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Female; Fiji; Helminthiasis; Humans; Infant; Insecticides; Ivermectin; Male; Middle Aged; Neglected Diseases; Rural Population; Scabies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",English,,PacELF_3222 Hardy et al 2020 PLOS NTDs The-safety-of-combined-triple-drug-therapy-with-ivermectin-diethylcarbamazine-and-albendazole-in-the-NTD-coendemic-setting-of-fiji.pdf

From afingerprick, the circulating filarial antigen (CFA) positivity was checked for grade 2-5 students using BinaxNOW filariasis test (immunochromatographic test). Of 935 children tested, three were positive for CFAintwo schools. At the territory level, this was below the critical cutoff of nine cases, if the whole territory was considered as a single evaluation unit. The prevalence of CFA in WAF is less than 1%, reaching the goal for LF elimination set by the WHO. We were able to recommend stopping LF MDA and move to post-MDA surveillance to detect any recrudescence. This survey successfully paved the way for WAF to be validated as achieving LF elimination as a public health problem by 2020.

3224,JCU,841,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Burden of hydrocoele assessed from medical and surgical records in a lymphatic filariasis endemic country, Samoa","Background: Samoa is a Pacific Island country that has long been known to have a high burden of lymphatic filariasis. Little has been documented about the burden of disability due to the chronic complications of the disease. We examined the rates of hydrocoele amongst the Samoan male population to better understand the situation. Methods: Information on numbers of suspected hydrocoele cases in men aged 18 years and older from 2006 to 2013 was sought using ICD-10 codes and/or keywords from three sources: the hospital patient information system plus the surgical clinic and operating theater records in Tupua Tamasese Meaole and Malietoa Tanumafili II hospitals in Samoa. Chart review of suspected hydrocoele cases was used to confirm the diagnosis of hydrocoele amongst suspected cases. The following data items were extracted from patient records where available: date of diagnosis, age, village, hydrocoele characteristics (duration, size, and volume), history and cause of injuries, whether lymphatic filariasis was a differential diagnosis, whether ultrasound scan was used to verify diagnosis, and details of any surgery performed. Population data were obtained from the Samoa Bureau of Statistics. Results: There were 535 suspected cases identified from the 3 sources between 2006 and 2013, of which 328 were diagnosed as hydrocoele; charts for 56 suspected cases (10.5%) could not be located. The mean age of men with hydrocoele was 49.2 years. The proportion of men aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with hydrocoele over the study period was 0.62% (328/52,944). North West Upolu had the highest proportion amongst the four regions of Samoa (p < 0.001). The proportion of men presenting with hydrocoele increased with age (p < 0.001). 14.3% of patients had an injury that could have contributed to the hydrocoele. Only 4.0% of all patient records had lymphatic filariasis recorded as a differential diagnosis. 60.7% of all patients with hydrocoele had some form of surgery, with no difference between regions (p = 0.276). The majority of surgeries were hydrocoelectomies, where the tunica vaginalis is everted. The mean age of patients that had surgery was 48.2 years. It was difficult to estimate hydrocoele size and duration due to non-standardized way of reporting. Conclusions: This study used multiple sources to document the number of hydrocoele cases that presented annually to medical facilities in Samoa. This represents a minimum estimate of the burden since some cases may have not presented for treatment. The numbers presenting have fluctuated over the years (2006 to 2013), and improvements in the reporting system are needed. The health system needs to consider ways to address a large number of patients that still require surgery, as well as conducting follow-up of those that did receive surgery. Additionally, clinicians should consider lymphatic filariasis as a differential diagnosis for hydrocoeles. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,"Ah Leong-Lui T.A., Graves P.M., Naseri T.",Tropical Medicine and Health,,47(1),51,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-019-0179-0,Samoa,3224,Open,Health information systems; Hydrocoele; Lymphatic filariasis; Samoa; Surgery,adult; Article; differential diagnosis; disease burden; disease duration; echography; endemic disease; hospital information system; human; hydrocele; ICD-10; injury; lymphatic filariasis; major clinical study; male; male genital system surgery; medical history; medical record; medical record review; middle aged; Samoa; tunica vaginalis,English,,PacELF_3224 Ah Leong-Lui et al 2020 Burden-of-hydrocoele-assessed-from-medical-and-surgical-records-in-a-lymphatic-filariasis-endemic-country-SamoaTropical-Medicine-and-Health.pdf
3225,JCU,842,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem from Tonga,"Background: Tonga was highly endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by diurnally sub-periodic Wuchereria bancrofti transmitted by Aedes vector species. LF prevalence declined very appreciably as a result of chemotherapeutic intervention measures implemented in 1977, but low levels of infection persisted. Along with other Pacific Island countries and in partnership with the Pacific Programme to Eliminate LF (PacELF), Tonga implemented a programme to eliminate LF as a public health problem. Methods: On the basis of historical data and baseline survey, all the divisions of the country were declared as endemic. Five to six consecutive rounds of effective MDA were implemented in all the divisions during 2001-2006. The impact of MDA was assessed through interim and post-MDA antigen (Ag) detection surveys among adults and transmission assessment surveys among children. The chronic disease burden was assessed by health workers through observation. Results: The base-line Ag prevalence was 2.70%. The treatment coverage was > 80% in all MDA rounds. The mid-term surveys showed an Ag prevalence of 2.46%. The pre-stop MDA Ag survey revealed an Ag prevalence of 0.34%. The stop MDA survey and transmission assessment surveys among children showed Ag prevalence at < 0.05%, indicating transmission is negligible. Health workers concluded that filarial lymphedema or hydrocele condition in the communities is absent or very rare. Conclusion: Tonga had successfully met the criteria for elimination of LF as a public health problem. The accomplishment was acknowledged by the WHO in 2017. Tonga looks forward to work with stakeholders to eliminate transmission of LF and achieve zero incidence of infection. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,"Ofanoa, R., Ofa, T., Padmasiri, E.A., Kapa, D.R.",Tropical Medicine and Health,,47(1),43,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-019-0169-2,Tonga,3225,Open,Elimination; Lymphatic filariasis; PacELF; Tonga; Wuchereria bancrofti,adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; community; disease elimination; disease surveillance; female; health care personnel; health survey; human; hydrocele; lymphatic filariasis; major clinical study; male; prevalence; public health problem; Tonga,English,,PacELF_3225 Ofanoa et al 2019 TROP MED HLTH Elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis-as-a-public-health-problem-from-TongaTropical-Medicine-and-Health.pdf
3226,JCU,843,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in Niue under PacELF, 1999-2016","Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease which is targeted for elimination as a public health problem worldwide. Niue is a small self-governing South Pacific island nation with approximately 1600 residents that was formerly LF endemic. Here, we review the progress made towards eliminating LF in Niue since 1999. Methods: This study has reviewed all the available literature relating to LF in Niue to assess surveillance efforts and the elimination of transmission. Reviewed documentation included both published and unpublished works including historical reports of LF, WHO PacELF records, and Niue Country Reports of the national LF elimination program. Findings: Niue conducted mapping of baseline LF endemicity by testing the total present and consenting population for LF antigen with immunochromatographic test (ICT) in 1999, when circulating filarial antigen prevalence was 3.1% (n = 1794). Five nationwide annual mass drug administration (MDA) rounds with albendazole (400 mg) and diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) were undertaken from 2000 to 2004, with coverage reported from distribution records ranging from 78 to 99% of the eligible population, which excluded pregnant women and children under 2 years of age. A further whole population survey using ICT in 2001 found 1.3% positive (n = 1630). In 2004, antigen prevalence had reduced to 0.2% (n = 1285). A similar post-MDA survey in 2009 indicated antigen prevalence to be 0.5% (n = 1378). Seven positive cases were re-tested and re-treated every six months until negative. Conclusions: After five rounds of MDA, Niue had reduced the LF antigen population prevalence in all ages from 3.1% to below 1% and maintained this prevalence for a further five years. Due to Niue's small population, surveillance was done by whole population surveys. Niue's results support the WHO recommended strategy that five to six rounds of annual MDA with effective population coverage can successfully interrupt the transmission of LF. Niue received official acknowledgement of the validation of elimination of LF as a public health problem by the WHO Director-General and WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) Regional Director at the 67th session of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific held in Manila in October 2016. © 2019 World Health Organization.",2019,"Carlingford, C.N., Melrose, W., Mokoia, G., Graves, P.M., Ichimori, K., Capuano, C., Kim, S.H., Aratchige, P., Nosa, M.",Tropical Medicine and Health,,47(1),20,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-019-0141-1,Niue,3226,Open,Epidemiology; Lymphatic filariasis; Mass drug administration; Microfilaria; Niue; PacELF; Wuchereria bancrofti,albendazole; diethylcarbamazine; parasite antigen; absenteeism; adult; Article; disease surveillance; elephantiasis; endemic disease; female; health survey; human; hydrocele; immunoaffinity chromatography; lymphatic filariasis; lymphedema; male; mass drug administration; middle aged; morbidity; Niue; nonhuman; parasite clearance; population research; prevalence; public health problem; vector control; World Health Organization; Wuchereria bancrofti,English,,PacELF_3226 Carlingford et al 2019 TROP MED HLTH Elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis-as-a-public-health-problem-in-Niue-under-PacELF-19992016Tropical-Medicine-and-Health.pdf
3227,JCU,844,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,GEOFIL: A spatially-explicit agent-based modelling framework for predicting the long-term transmission dynamics of lymphatic filariasis in American Samoa,"In this study, a spatially-explicit agent-based modelling framework GEOFIL was developed to predict lymphatic filariasis (LF) transmission dynamics in American Samoa. GEOFIL included individual-level information on age, gender, disease status, household location, household members, workplace/school location and colleagues/schoolmates at each time step during the simulation. In American Samoa, annual mass drug administration from 2000 to 2006 successfully reduced LF prevalence dramatically. However, GEOFIL predicted continual increase in microfilaraemia prevalence in the absence of further intervention. Evidence from seroprevalence and transmission assessment surveys conducted from 2010 to 2016 indicated a resurgence of LF in American Samoa, corroborating GEOFIL's predictions. The microfilaraemia and antigenaemia prevalence in 6-7-yo children were much lower than in the overall population. Mosquito biting rates were found to be a critical determinant of infection risk. Transmission hotspots are likely to disappear with lower biting rates. GEOFIL highlights current knowledge gaps, such as data on mosquito abundance, biting rates and within-host parasite dynamics, which are important for improving the accuracy of model predictions. © 2019 The Authors",2019,"Xu, Z., Graves, P.M., Lau, C.L., Clements, A., Geard, N., Glass, K.",Epidemics,,27,19-27,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2018.12.003,American Samoa,3227,Open,Agent-based modelling; Commuting networks; Disease dynamics; Lymphatic filariasis; Spatial heterogeneity; Vector-borne diseases,"filarial antigen; parasite antigen; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; age; aged; American Samoa; Article; child; demography; employment status; female; gender; health status; household; human; infection risk; lymphatic filariasis; major clinical study; male; mass drug administration; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; microfilariasis; mosquito bite; parasite transmission; population dynamics; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; school attendance; sensitivity analysis; seroprevalence; simulation; spatial analysis; traffic and transport; workplace; Aedes; animal; insect bite; lymphatic filariasis; preschool child; questionnaire; seroepidemiology; theoretical model; time; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aedes; American Samoa; Animals; Child; Child, Preschool; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Female; Humans; Insect Bites and Stings; Male; Models, Theoretical; Prevalence; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time; Young Adult",English,,PacELF_3226 Xu et al 2019 EPIDEMICS GEOFIL-A-spatiallyexplicit-agentbased-modelling-framework-for-predicting-the-longterm-transmission-dynamics-of-lymphatic-filariasis-in-American-Samoa.pdf
3228,JCU,845,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Human Migration and the Spread of the Nematode Parasite Wuchereria bancrofti,"The human disease lymphatic filariasis causes the debilitating effects of elephantiasis and hydrocele. Lymphatic filariasis currently affects the lives of 90 million people in 52 countries. There are three nematodes that cause lymphatic filariasis, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti, but 90% of all cases of lymphatic filariasis are caused solely by W. bancrofti (Wb). Here we use population genomics to reconstruct the probable route and timing of migration of Wb strains that currently infect Africa, Haiti, and Papua New Guinea (PNG). We used selective whole genome amplification to sequence 42 whole genomes of single Wb worms from populations in Haiti, Mali, Kenya, and PNG. Our results are consistent with a hypothesis of an Island Southeast Asia or East Asian origin of Wb. Our demographic models support divergence times that correlate with the migration of human populations. We hypothesize that PNG was infected at two separate times, first by the Melanesians and later by the migrating Austronesians. The migrating Austronesians also likely introduced Wb to Madagascar where later migrations spread it to continental Africa. From Africa, Wb spread to the New World during the transatlantic slave trade. Genome scans identified 17 genes that were highly differentiated among Wb populations. Among these are genes associated with human immune suppression, insecticide sensitivity, and proposed drug targets. Identifying the distribution of genetic diversity in Wb populations and selection forces acting on the genome will build a foundation to test future hypotheses and help predict response to current eradication efforts. © 2019 The Author(s).

3230,JCU,847,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Investigation of mixture modelling algorithms as a tool for determining the statistical likelihood of serological exposure to filariasis utilizing historical data from the lymphatic filariasis surveillance program in Vanuatu,"As the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis declines, it becomes crucial to adequately eliminate residual areas of endemicity and implement surveillance. To this end, serological assays have been developed, including the Bm14 Filariasis CELISA which recommends a specific optical density cut-off level. We used mixture modelling to assess positive cut-offs of Bm14 serology in children in Vanuatu using historical OD (Optical Density) ELISA values collected from a transmission assessment survey (2005) and a targeted child survey (2008). Mixture modelling is a statistical technique using probability distributions to identify subpopulations of positive and negative results (absolute cut-off value) and an 80% indeterminate range around the absolute cut-off (80% cut-off). Depending on programmatic choices, utilizing the lower 80% cut-off ensures the inclusion of all likely positives, however with the trade-off of lower specificity. For 2005, country-wide antibody prevalence estimates varied from 6.4% (previous cut-off) through 9.0% (absolute cut-off) to 17.3% (lower 80% cut-off). This corroborated historical evidence of hotspots in Pentecost Island in Penama province. For 2008, there were no differences in the prevalence rates using any of the thresholds. In conclusion, mixture modelling is a powerful tool that allows closer monitoring of residual transmission spots and these findings supported additional monitoring which was conducted in Penama in later years. Utilizing a statistical data-based cut-off, as opposed to a universal cut-off, may help guide program decisions that are better suited to the national program. © 2019 by the authors.

3231,JCU,848,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"The safety of double-and triple-drug community mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis: A multicenter, open-label, cluster-randomized study","Background The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) provides antifilarial medications to hundreds of millions of people annually to treat filarial infections and prevent ele-phantiasis. Recent trials have shown that a single-dose, triple-drug treatment (ivermectin with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole [IDA]) is superior to a two-drug combination (diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole [DA]) that is widely used in LF elimination programs. This study was performed to assess the safety of IDA and DA in a variety of endemic settings. Methods and findings Large community studies were conducted in five countries between October 2016 and November 2017. Two studies were performed in areas with no prior mass drug administration (MDA) for filariasis (Papua New Guinea and Indonesia), and three studies were performed in areas with persistent LF despite extensive prior MDA (India, Haiti, and Fiji). Participants were treated with a single oral dose of IDA (ivermectin, 200 μg/kg; diethylcarbamazine, 6 mg/kg; plus albendazole, a fixed dose of 400 mg) or with DA alone. Treatment assignment in each study site was randomized by locality of residence. Treatment was offered to residents who were ≥5 years of age and not pregnant. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by medical teams with active follow-up for 2 days and passive follow-up for an additional 5 days. A total of 26,836 persons were enrolled (13,535 females and 13,300 males). A total of 12,280 participants were treated with DA, and 14,556 were treated with IDA. On day 1 or 2 after treatment, 97.4% of participants were assessed for AEs. The frequency of all AEs was similar after IDA and DA treatment (12% versus 12.1%, adjusted odds ratio for IDA versus DA 1.15, 95% CI 0.87–1.52, P = 0.316); 10.9% of participants experienced mild (grade 1) AEs, 1% experienced moderate (grade 2) AEs, and 0.1% experienced severe (grade 3) AEs. Rates of serious AEs after DA and IDA treatment were 0.04% (95% CI 0.01%–0.1%) and 0.01% (95% CI 0.00%–0.04%), respectively. Severity of AEs was not significantly different after IDA or DA. Five of six serious AEs reported occurred after DA treatment. The most common AEs reported were headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and fatigue. AE frequencies varied by country and were higher in adults and in females. AEs were more common in study participants with microfilaremia (33.4% versus 11.1%, P < 0.001) and more common in microfilaremic participants after IDA than after DA (39.4% versus 25.6%, P < 0.001). However, there was no excess of severe or serious AEs after IDA in this subgroup. The main limitation of the study was that it was open-label. Also, aggregation of AE data from multiple study sites tends to obscure variability among study sites. Conclusions In this study, we observed that IDA was well tolerated in LF-endemic populations. Posttreat-ment AE rates and severity did not differ significantly after IDA or DA treatment. Thus, results of this study suggest that IDA should be as safe as DA for use as a MDA regimen for LF elimination in areas that currently receive DA. © 2019, Public Library of Science.

3233,JCU,850,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,A trial of a triple-drug treatment for lymphatic filariasis,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has targeted lymphatic filariasis for global elimination by 2020 with a strategy of mass drug administration. This trial tested whether a single dose of a three-drug regimen of ivermectin plus diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole results in a greater sustained clearance of microfilariae than a single dose of a two-drug regimen of diethylcarbamazine plus albendazole and is noninferior to the two-drug regimen administered once a year for 3 years. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled trial involving adults from Papua New Guinea with Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaremia, we assigned 182 participants to receive a single dose of the three-drug regimen (60 participants), a single dose of the two-drug regimen (61 participants), or the two-drug regimen once a year for 3 years (61 participants). Clearance of microfilariae from the blood was measured at 12, 24, and 36 months after trial initiation. RESULTS: The three-drug regimen cleared microfilaremia in 55 of 57 participants (96%) at 12 months, in 52 of 54 participants (96%) at 24 months, and in 55 of 57 participants (96%) at 36 months. A single dose of the two-drug regimen cleared microfilaremia in 18 of 56 participants (32%) at 12 months, in 31 of 55 participants (56%) at 24 months, and in 43 of 52 participants (83%) at 36 months (P=0.02 for the three-drug regimen vs. a single dose of the two-drug regimen at 36 months). The two-drug regimen administered once a year for 3 years cleared microfilaremia in 20 of 59 participants (34%) at 12 months, in 42 of 56 participants (75%) at 24 months, and in 51 of 52 participants (98%) at 36 months (P=0.004 for noninferiority of the three-drug regimen vs. the two-drug regimen administered once a year for 3 years at 36 months). Moderate adverse events were more common in the group that received the three-drug regimen than in the combined two-drug-regimen groups (27% vs. 5%, P<0.001). There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The three-drug regimen induced clearance of microfilariae from the blood for 3 years in almost all participants who received the treatment and was superior to the two-drug regimen administered once and noninferior to the two-drug regimen administered once a year for 3 years.

With the 2020 target year for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) approaching, there is an urgent need to assess how long mass drug administration (MDA) programs with annual ivermectin + albendazole (IA) or diethylcarbamazine + albendazole (DA) would still have to be continued, and how elimination can be accelerated. We addressed this using mathematical modeling. Methods. We used 3 structurally different mathematical models for LF transmission (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, TRANSFIL) to simulate trends in microfilariae (mf) prevalence for a range of endemic settings, both for the current annual MDA strategy and alternative strategies, assessing the required duration to bring mf prevalence below the critical threshold of 1%. Results. Three annual MDA rounds with IA or DA and good coverage (≥65%) are sufficient to reach the threshold in settings that are currently at mf prevalence <4%, but the required duration increases with increasing mf prevalence. Switching to biannual MDA or employing triple-drug therapy (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole [IDA]) could reduce program duration by about one-third. Optimization of coverage reduces the time to elimination and is particularly important for settings with a history of poorly implemented MDA (low coverage, high systematic noncompliance). Conclusions. Modeling suggests that, in several settings, current annual MDA strategies will be insufficient to achieve the 2020 LF elimination targets, and programs could consider policy adjustment to accelerate, guided by recent monitoring and evaluation data. Biannual treatment and IDA hold promise in reducing program duration, provided that coverage is good, but their efficacy remains to be confirmed by more extensive field studies. © The Author(s) 2018.

3235,JCU,852,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Combining different diagnostic studies of lymphatic filariasis for risk mapping in Papua New Guinea: A predictive model from microfilaraemia and antigenaemia prevalence surveys 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1117 Public Health and Health Services Peter Wood,"Background: The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis has encouraged countries to follow a set of guidelines to help them assess the need for mass drug administration and evaluate its progress. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is one of the highest priority countries in the Western Pacific for lymphatic filariasis and the site of extensive research on lymphatic filariasis and surveys of its prevalence. However, different diagnostic tests have been used and thresholds for each test are unclear. Methods: We reviewed the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis reported in 295 surveys conducted in PNG between 1990 and 2014, of which 65 used more than one test. Results from different diagnostics were standardised using a set of criteria that included a model to predict antigen prevalence from microfilariae prevalence. We mapped the point location of each of these surveys and categorised their standardised prevalence estimates. Results: Several predictive models were produced and investigated, including the effect of any mass drug administration and number of rounds prior to the surveys. One model was chosen based on goodness of fit parameters and used to predict antigen prevalence for surveys that tested only for microfilariae. Standardised prevalence values show that 72% of all surveys reported a prevalence above 0.05. High prevalence was situated on the coastal north, south and island regions, while the central highland area of Papua New Guinea shows low levels of prevalence. Conclusions: Our study is the first to provide an explicit predictive relationship between the prevalence values based on empirical results from antigen and microfilaria tests, taking into account the occurrence of mass drug administration. This is a crucial step to combine studies to develop risk maps of lymphatic filariasis for programme planning and evaluation, as shown in the case of Papua New Guinea. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,"Berg Soto, A., Xu, Z., Wood, P., Sanuku, N., Robinson, L.J., King, C.L., Tisch, D., Susapu, M., Graves, P.M.",Tropical Medicine and Health,,46(1),41,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-018-0123-8,Papua New Guinea,3235,Open,Diagnostic tests; Lymphatic filariasis; Papua New Guinea; Predictive model; Prevalence; Risk map,albendazole; antigen detection; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; geographic mapping; health program; health survey; human; lymphatic filariasis; microfilariasis; Papua New Guinea; program development; Review; risk assessment,English,,PacELF_3235 Berg Soto et al 2018 TROP MED HEALTH Combining-different-diagnostic-studies-of-lymphatic-filariasis-for-risk-mapping-in-Papua-New-Guinea-.pdf
3236,JCU,853,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Comparison of antigen and antibody responses in repeat lymphatic filariasis transmission assessment surveys in American Samoa,"Background: Current WHO recommendations for lymphatic filariasis (LF) surveillance advise programs to implement activities to monitor for new foci of transmission after stopping mass drug administration (MDA). A current need in the global effort to eliminate LF is to standardize diagnostic tools and surveillance activities beyond the recommended transmission assessment survey (TAS). Methodology: TAS was first conducted in American Samoa in 2011 (TAS 1) and a repeat TAS was carried out in 2015 (TAS 2). Circulating filarial antigen (CFA) and serologic results from both surveys were analyzed to determine whether interruption of LF transmission has been achieved in American Samoa. Principal findings: A total of 1,134 and 864 children (5–10 years old) were enrolled in TAS 1 and TAS 2, respectively. Two CFA-positive children were identified in TAS 1, and one CFA-positive child was identified in TAS 2. Results of both surveys were below the threshold for which MDA was warranted. Additionally, 1,112 and 836 dried blood spots from TAS 1 and TAS 2, respectively were tested for antibodies to Wb123, Bm14 and Bm33 by luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay and multiplex bead assay. In 2011, overall prevalence of responses to Wb123, Bm14, and Bm33 was 1.0%, 6.8% and 12.0%, respectively. In 2015, overall prevalence of positive Bm14 and Bm33 responses declined significantly to 3.0% (p<0.001) and 7.8% (p = 0.013), respectively. Conclusions/Significance: Although passing TAS 1 and TAS 2 and an overall decline in the prevalence of antibodies to Bm14 and Bm33 between these surveys suggests decreased exposure and infection among young children, there were persistent responses in some schools. Clustering and persistence of positive antibody responses in schools may be an indication of ongoing transmission. There is a need to better understand the limitations of current antibody tests, but our results suggest that serologic tools can have a role in guiding programmatic decision making. © 2018 Public Library of Science.

3237,JCU,854,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem from the Cook Islands,"Background: The Cook Islands has a long history of high-endemicity lymphatic filariasis (LF) transmitted by Aedes vector mosquitoes. Though the infection prevalence had declined between 1975 and 1999 following episodic treatment activities, still infection was widespread with pockets of persistent infection. Beginning in 1999, the Cook Islands embarked on a national program, in partnership with Pacific Programme to Eliminate LF (PacELF), to eliminate LF as a public health problem. Methods: All 12 inhabited islands were identified as endemic, and six rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with once-yearly, single-dose albendazole plus diethylcarbamazine (DEC) were implemented during 2000-2006 to interrupt transmission of LF. Surveys carried out at the baseline, mid-term, stop-MDA, and post-MDA periods assessed LF antigen (Ag) prevalence in children and adults. Historical data, health workers' observations, and hospital records were used to assess the trend and burden of chronic disease. Results: The baseline Ag prevalence (1999) ranged from 2.0% in Manihiki to > 18.0% in Aitutaki, Mitiaro, and Pukapuka, and the national average Ag prevalence was 8.6%. MDA, carried out with a national treatment coverage over six annual rounds of MDA ranging from 63.5 to 96.7% in different years, was stopped in 2007. By then, the national Ag prevalence had declined to 0.27%. The post-MDA surveillance survey results (2013-2014) showed that Ag prevalence had fallen to 0% in 11/12 islands, and the national prevalence was only 0.03%. Chronic filarial disease had almost entirely disappeared. Conclusion: The Cook Islands met all the criteria required for the World Health Organization (WHO) to acknowledge elimination of LF as a public health problem, as it did officially in 2016. This success also confirms that LF, even when transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that are recognized to be more efficient than other vector species, can be eliminated as a public health problem by six rounds of MDA. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,"Ave, C., Kapa, D.R., Ottesen, E.",Tropical Medicine and Health,,46(1),12,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-018-0094-9,Cook Islands,3237,Open,Cook Islands; Elimination; Lymphatic filariasis; PacELF,albendazole; diethylcarbamazine; parasite antigen; adult; Article; child; Cook Islands; disease burden; disease surveillance; endemic disease; health care personnel; health care survey; health program; human; lymphatic filariasis; major clinical study; medical record; parasite clearance; parasite transmission; prevalence; program impact; public health problem; single drug dose,English,,PacELF_3237 Ave et al 2018 TROP MED HEALTH Elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis-as-a-public-health-problem-from-the-Cook-IslandsTropical-Medicine-and-Health.pdf

All grade 1 and 2 students of 69 schools on the two main islands were targeted in two phases (one in the Western Division and the other in the Central and Northern Divisions, except Taveuni sub-Division of Northern), where fecal samples of 1,800 students were available for coproscopy using formalin-etheracetate concentration. The overall prevalence of Giardia infection was 1.6%, having 2.2% in Western and 0.8% in Central/ Northern Divisions (P = 0.094). The school-level prevalence of giardiasis ranged from 0% to 15.4%, and hotspot analysis using the Getis-Ord Gi∗ method detected spatial heterogeneity of giardiasis prevalence in schools around Lautoka (Z-score = 3.36, P value < 0.05), an area affected by Cyclone Kofi in February 2014. Any protozoan infection prevalence was 4.9% in Western and 4.4% in Central/Northern Divisions (P = 0.825). Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis to confirm the findings from a parasitological examination of a 10% stool archive in 95% ethanol from Western Division revealed an elevated prevalence of giardiasis up to 22.4%, the presence of Entamoeba histolytica, and the absence of Cryptosporidium parvum. Obtaining stool samples alongside LF TAS is a convenient access platform for cosurveillance of gastrointestinal protozoan infection and has pinpointed hitherto unknown hotspots of giardiasis in urban city centers of Fiji. This calls for greater attention to apply tailored water, sanitation and hygiene measures for the control of these parasites. © 2018 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",2018,"Kim, S.H., Rinamalo, M., Rainima-Qaniuci, M., Talemaitoga, N., Kama, M., Rafai, E., Lowry, J.H., Choi, M.-H., Hong, S.-T., Verweij, J.J., Kelly-Hope, L., Stothard, J.R.",American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,,98(4),1179-1185,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.17-0559,Fiji,3239,Open,,"alcohol; Article; child; cross-sectional study; Cryptosporidium parvum; disease surveillance; Entamoeba histolytica; feces analysis; female; Fiji; gastrointestinal infection; giardiasis; health survey; human; lymphatic filariasis transmission assessment survey; major clinical study; male; parasitology; prevalence; protozoal infection; real time polymerase chain reaction; school; student; intestine infection; lymphatic filariasis; preschool child; transmission; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Female; Giardiasis; Humans; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic; Male; Prevalence; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",English,,PacELF_3239 Kim et al 2018 AJTMH Islandwide-surveillance-of-gastrointestinal-protozoan-infection-on-Fiji-by-expanding-lymphatic-filariasis-transmission-assessment-surveys-as-an-access-platform.pdf
3242,JCU,859,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Specific human antibody responses to Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis saliva: a new epidemiological tool to assess human exposure to disease vectors in the Pacific,"Background: Aedes mosquitoes severely affect the health and wellbeing of human populations by transmitting infectious diseases. In French Polynesia, Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, and Aedes polynesiensis the primary vector of Bancroftian filariasis and a secondary vector of arboviruses. Tools for assessing the risk of disease transmission or for measuring the efficacy of vector control programmes are scarce. A promising approach to quantify the human-vector contact relies on the detection and the quantification of antibodies directed against mosquito salivary proteins. Methodology/Principal findings: An ELISA test was developed to detect and quantify the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against proteins from salivary gland extracts (SGE) of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis in human populations exposed to either species, through a cross-sectional study. In Tahiti and Moorea islands where Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis are present, the test revealed that 98% and 68% of individuals have developed IgG directed against Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE, respectively. By comparison, ELISA tests conducted on a cohort of people from metropolitan France, not exposed to these Aedes mosquitoes, indicated that 97% of individuals had no IgG directed against SGE of either mosquito species. The analysis of additional cohorts representing different entomological Aedes contexts showed no ELISA IgG cross-reactivity between Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE. Conclusions/Significance: The IgG response to salivary gland extracts seems to be a valid and specific biomarker of human exposure to the bites of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis. This new immuno-epidemiological tool will enhance our understanding of people exposure to mosquito bites, facilitate the identification of areas where disease transmission risk is high and permit to evaluate the efficacy of novel vector control strategies in Pacific islands and other tropical settings. © 2018 Mathieu-Daudé et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",2018,"Mathieu-Daudé, F., Claverie, A., Plichart, C., Boulanger, D., Mphande, F.A., Bossin, H.C.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,,12(7),e0006660,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006660,French Polynesia,3242,Open,,immunoglobulin G; saliva protein; insect protein; saliva protein; Aedes aegypti; antibody response; Arbovirus; Article; communicable disease; cross-sectional study; disease carrier; disease transmission; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; French Polynesia; mosquito bite; mosquito vector; nonhuman; saliva; salivary gland; vector control; adolescent; adult; Aedes; animal; antibody production; blood; chemistry; child; classification; cohort analysis; female; genetics; human; immunology; insect bite; male; middle aged; Pacific islands; parasitology; Polynesia; saliva; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aedes; Animals; Antibody Formation; Child; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Insect Bites and Stings; Insect Proteins; Male; Middle Aged; Mosquito Vectors; Pacific Islands; Polynesia; Saliva; Salivary Proteins and Peptides; Young Adult,English,,PacELF_3242 Matthieu-Daude et al 2018 PLOS NTDs Specific-human-antibody-responses-to-Aedes-aegypti-and-Aedes-polynesiensis-saliva.pdf

The majority of LF infections are caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, named in honour of the Australian physician Joseph Bancroft, with the remainder due to Brugia malayi and B. timori. Infection with LF through the bite of an infected mosquito, can lead to the development of the condition known as elephantiasis, where swelling due to oedema leads to loss of function in the affected area and thickening of the skin, ‘like an elephant'. LF has previously been endemic in Australia, although currently, no autochthonous cases occur there. Human immigration to Australia from LF-endemic countries, including those close to Australia, and the presence of susceptible mosquitoes that can act as suitable vectors, heighten the possibility of the reintroduction of LF into this country. In this review, we examine the history of LF in Australia and Oceania and weigh up the potential risk of its re-occurrence on mainland Australia. © 2018 by the authors.",2018,"Gordon, C.A., Jones, M.K., McManus, D.P.",Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease,,3(2),58,https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed3020058,Multicountry Pacific,3243,Open,Elephantiasis; Lymphatic filariasis; Wuchereria bancrofti,,English,,PacELF_3243 Gordon et al TMID HIstory of LF Australia tropicalmed-03-00058 (2).pdf
3244,JCU,861,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Understanding heterogeneities in mosquito-bite exposure and infection distributions for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis,"It is well known that individuals in the same community can be exposed to a highly variable number of mosquito bites. This heterogeneity in bite exposure has consequences for the control of vector-borne diseases because a few people may be contributing significantly to transmission. However, very few studies measure sources of heterogeneity in a way which is relevant to decision-making. We investigate the relationship between two classic measures of heterogeneity, spatial and individual, within the context of lymphatic filariasis, a parasitic mosquito-borne disease. Using infection and mosquito-bite data for five villages in Papua New Guinea, we measure biting characteristics to model what impact bed-nets have had on control of the disease. We combine this analysis with geospatial modelling to understand the spatial relationship between disease indicators and nightly mosquito bites. We found a weak association between biting and infection heterogeneity within villages. The introduction of bed-nets increased biting heterogeneity, but the reduction in mean biting more than compensated for this, by reducing prevalence closer to elimination thresholds. Nightly biting was explained by a spatial heterogeneity model, while parasite load was better explained by an individual heterogeneity model. Spatial and individual heterogeneity are qualitatively different with profoundly different policy implications. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,"Irvine, M.A., Kazura, J.W., Hollingsworth, T.D., Reimer, L.J.",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,,285(1871),20172253,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.2253,Papua New Guinea,3244,Open,Bite heterogeneity; Geospatial model; Lymphatic filariasis; Spatial heterogeneity; Vector control,"decision making; disease control; disease transmission; disease vector; filariasis; heterogeneity; mosquito; numerical model; parasite intensity; spatial analysis; Papua New Guinea; animal; Anopheles; environment; female; human; insect bite; insecticide treated net; lymphatic filariasis; male; mosquito control; mosquito vector; Papua New Guinea; physiology; prevalence; procedures; spatial analysis; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; Animals; Anopheles; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Environment; Female; Humans; Insect Bites and Stings; Insecticide-Treated Bednets; Male; Models, Theoretical; Mosquito Control; Mosquito Vectors; Papua New Guinea; Prevalence; Spatial Analysis",English,,PacELF_3244 Irvine et al 2018 PROC ROY SOC LOND B Understanding-heterogeneities-in-mosquitobite-exposure-and-infection-distributions-for-the-elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis.pdf
3245,JCU,862,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Zika virus outbreak in the Pacific: Vector competence of regional vectors,"Background: In 2013, Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in French Polynesia and spread through the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. Several potential Aedes mosquitoes may have contributed to the ZIKV transmission including Aedes aegypti, the main arbovirus vector in the region, and Aedes polynesiensis, vector of lymphatic filariasis and secondary vector of dengue virus. The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of these two Pacific vectors to transmit ZIKV at a regional scale, through the evaluation and comparison of the vector competence of wild Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis populations from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain which circulated in this region during the 2013–2017 outbreak. Methodology/principal findings: Field Ae. aegypti (three populations) and Ae. polynesiensis (two populations) from the Pacific region were collected for this study. Female mosquitoes were orally exposed to ZIKV (107TCID50/mL) isolated in the region in 2014. At 6, 9, 14 and 21 days post-infection, mosquito bodies (thorax and abdomen), heads and saliva were analyzed to measure infection, dissemination, transmission rates and transmission efficiency, respectively. According to our results, ZIKV infection rates were heterogeneous between the Ae. aegypti populations, but the dissemination rates were moderate and more homogenous between these populations. For Ae. polynesiensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between the two populations tested. The transmission rate and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study. Conclusion/significance: Our results indicated a low ZIKV transmission by Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis tested from the Pacific region. These results were unexpected and suggest the importance of other factors especially the vector density, the mosquito lifespan or the large immunologically naive fraction of the population that may have contributed to the rapid spread of the ZIKV in the Pacific region during the 2013–2017 outbreak. © 2018 Calvez et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",2018,"Calvez, E., Mousson, L., Vazeille, M., O’Connor, O., Cao-Lormeau, V.-M., Mathieu-Daudé, F., Pocquet, N., Failloux, A.-B., Dupont-Rouzeyrol, M.",PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,,12(7),e0006637,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006637,Multicountry Pacific,3245,Open,,virus vector; adult; Aedes; Aedes aegypti; Aedes polynesiensis; animal cell; Article; epidemic; female; French Polynesian; ID50 (infectious); infection rate; mouth infection; nonhuman; Pacific islands; saliva analysis; Samoan (people); vector control; virus detection; virus infection; virus transmission; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; genetics; human; isolation and purification; mosquito vector; physiology; saliva; transmission; virology; Zika fever; Zika virus; Aedes; Animals; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Mosquito Vectors; Pacific Islands; Saliva; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection,English,,PacELF_3245 Calvez et al PLOS NTDs Zika-virus-outbreak-in-the-Pacific-Vector-competence-of-regional-vectorsPLoS-Neglected-Tropical-Diseases.pdf

In this study, a synthetic population was developed for American Samoa using an iterative approach based on population census, questionnaire survey and land use data. The population will be used as the basis for a new agent-based model, intended specifically to fill the knowledge gaps about lymphatic filariasis transmission and elimination, but also to be readily adaptable to model other infectious diseases. The synthetic population was characterized by the statistically realistic population and household structure, and high-resolution geographic locations of households. The population was simulated over 40 years from 2010 to 2050. The simulated population was compared to estimates and projections of the U.S. Census Bureau. The results showed the total population would continuously decrease due to the observed large number of emigrants. Population ageing was observed, which was consistent with the latest two population censuses and the Bureau's projections. The sex ratios by age groups were analysed and indicated an increase in the proportion of males in age groups 0-14 and 15-64.

3248,JCU,865,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Identification and control of an isolated, but intense focus of lymphatic filariasis on Satawal Island, Federated States of Micronesia, in 2003","Background: There is very limited data available on the prevalence of Bancroftian filariasis in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Considerable attempts to eliminate the disease had occurred in the Pacific region by the year 2003, and the prevalence in FSM was thought to be sufficiently low that the region was considered non-endemic. However, a survey conducted in 2003 on an isolated atoll of FSM, Satawal Island, challenged that assumption. Methods: Participants on Satawal Island were recruited and their blood tested for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen by the filariasis immunochromatographic test (ICT) card and circulating microfilaria by Knott's concentration technique. A survey for active cases of lymphoedema, elephantiasis and hydrocoele was performed and mosquitoes were trapped and dissected to detect larvae of W. bancrofti. Results: A total of 104 males and 149 females from early teens to mid-80s were tested. Men had a significantly higher prevalence of infection than women in both the ICT test (53 vs 28%; p < 0.001) and by Knott's concentration results (37 vs 11%; p < 0.001). Microfilaria prevalence was higher in subjects ≤25 than in those >25 years of age. All persons sampled were treated for LF. No cases of elephantiasis or hydrocoele were detected. No Aedes dissected were positive but three of nine culicine mosquitoes were positive for L1-3 larval stages of W. bancrofti by microscopy.

3249,JCU,866,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Impact of the Lymphatic Filariasis Control Program towards elimination of filariasis in Vanuatu, 1997-2006","Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. The filarial worms affect the lymphatic system which leads to abnormal enlargement of body parts, chronic pain, disability, and social discrimination. In 1999, a commitment was made to eliminate LF from the Pacific Region by 2010. The Pacific Program to Eliminate LF began, with Vanuatu being one of the 16 endemic countries included in this program. Methods: In 1997/1998 a LF prevalence baseline survey was conducted to determine the need for mass drug administration (MDA) in Vanuatu. In 1999, the Vanuatu Lymphatic Filariasis Control Program was established, and nationwide MDA was implemented from 2000 to 2004. LF prevalence was collected during the MDA through sentinel site and spot check surveys, and after 5 years of MDA. MDA implementation methods included health worker training, social mobilization, and culturally appropriate health promotion strategies. Results: LF prevalence at baseline was 4.79%; after MDA this declined to 0.16% in 2005/2006. Average MDA coverage ranged from 75.5-81.5% across 5 years. All three evaluation units surveyed in 2005/2006 were below the 1% threshold required to stop MDA. Conclusions: The LF Control Program between 1997 and 2006 was successful in reducing LF prevalence to <1%. High MDA coverage was a critical component of this success. This period of the Vanuatu LF Control Program played an important role in helping to eliminate LF in Vanuatu. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,"Allen T., Taleo F., Graves P.M., Wood P., Taleo G., Baker M.C., Bradley M., Ichimori K.",Tropical Medicine and Health,,45(1),8,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-017-0047-8,Vanuatu,3249,Open,Elimination; Lymphatic filariasis; Mass drug administration; PacELF; Vanuatu,age distribution; Article; bed net; controlled study; disease elimination; endemic disease; geographic distribution; health promotion; health survey; human; infection control; lymphatic filariasis; major clinical study; prevalence; Vanuatu,English,,PacELF_3249 Allen et al 2017 TMAH Vanuatu paper 1 s41182-017-0047-8.pdf
3250,JCU,867,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Measuring changes in transmission of neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and enteric pathogens from quantitative antibody levels","Background: Serological antibody levels are a sensitive marker of pathogen exposure, and advances in multiplex assays have created enormous potential for large-scale, integrated infectious disease surveillance. Most methods to analyze antibody measurements reduce quantitative antibody levels to seropositive and seronegative groups, but this can be difficult for many pathogens and may provide lower resolution information than quantitative levels. Analysis methods have predominantly maintained a single disease focus, yet integrated surveillance platforms would benefit from methodologies that work across diverse pathogens included in multiplex assays. Methods/Principal findings: We developed an approach to measure changes in transmission from quantitative antibody levels that can be applied to diverse pathogens of global importance. We compared age-dependent immunoglobulin G curves in repeated cross-sectional surveys between populations with differences in transmission for multiple pathogens, including: lymphatic filariasis (Wuchereria bancrofti) measured before and after mass drug administration on Mauke, Cook Islands, malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) before and after a combined insecticide and mass drug administration intervention in the Garki project, Nigeria, and enteric protozoans (Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba histolytica), bacteria (enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp.), and viruses (norovirus groups I and II) in children living in Haiti and the USA. Age-dependent antibody curves fit with ensemble machine learning followed a characteristic shape across pathogens that aligned with predictions from basic mechanisms of humoral immunity. Differences in pathogen transmission led to shifts in fitted antibody curves that were remarkably consistent across pathogens, assays, and populations. Mean antibody levels correlated strongly with traditional measures of transmission intensity, such as the entomological inoculation rate for P. falciparum (Spearman’s rho = 0.75). In both high- and low transmission settings, mean antibody curves revealed changes in population mean antibody levels that were masked by seroprevalence measures because changes took place above or below the seropositivity cutoff. Conclusions/Significance: Age-dependent antibody curves and summary means provided a robust and sensitive measure of changes in transmission, with greatest sensitivity among young children. The method generalizes to pathogens that can be measured in high-throughput, multiplex serological assays, and scales to surveillance activities that require high spatiotemporal resolution. Our results suggest quantitative antibody levels will be particularly useful to measure differences in exposure for pathogens that elicit a transient antibody response or for monitoring populations with very high- or very low transmission, when seroprevalence is less informative. The approach represents a new opportunity to conduct integrated serological surveillance for neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and other infectious diseases with well-defined antigen targets. © 2017 Public Library of Science.

3252,JCU,869,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Plasticity of host selection by malaria vectors of Papua New Guinea,"Background: Host selection is an important determinant of vectorial capacity because malaria transmission increases when mosquitoes feed more on humans than non-humans. Host selection also affects the outcome of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN). Despite the recent nationwide implementation of LLIN-based malaria control program in Papua New Guinea (PNG), little is known about the host selection of the local Anopheles vectors. This study investigated the host selection of Anopheles vectors in PNG. Methods: Blood-engorged mosquitoes were sampled using the barrier screen method and blood meals analyzed for vertebrate host source with PCR-amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Abundance of common hosts was estimated in surveys. The test of homogeneity of proportions and the Manly resource selection ratio were used to determine if hosts were selected in proportion to their abundance. Results: Two thousand four hundred and forty blood fed Anopheles females of seven species were sampled from five villages in Madang, PNG. Of 2,142 samples tested, 2,061 (96.2%) yielded a definitive host source; all were human, pig, or dog. Hosts were not selected in proportion to their abundance, but rather were under-selected or over-selected by the mosquitoes. Four species, Anopheles farauti (sensu stricto) (s.s.), Anopheles punctulatus (s.s.), Anopheles farauti no. 4 and Anopheles longirostris, over-selected humans in villages with low LLIN usage, but over-selected pigs in villages with high LLIN usage. Anopheles koliensis consistently over-selected humans despite high LLIN usage, and Anopheles bancroftii over-selected pigs. Conclusions: The plasticity of host selection of an Anopheles species depends on its opportunistic, anthropophilic or zoophilic behavior, and on the extent of host availability and LLIN usage where the mosquitoes forage for hosts. The high anthropophily of An. koliensis increases the likelihood of contacting the LLIN inside houses. This allows its population size to be reduced to levels insufficient to support transmission. In contrast, by feeding on alternative hosts the likelihood of the opportunistic species to contact LLIN is lower, making them difficult to control. By maintaining high population size, the proportion that feed on humans outdoors can sustain residual transmission despite high LLIN usage in the village. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,"Keven J.B., Reimer L., Katusele M., Koimbu G., Vinit R., Vincent N., Thomsen E., Foran D.R., Zimmerman P.A., Walker E.D.",Parasites and Vectors,,10(1),95,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2038-3,Papua New Guinea,3252,Open,Anopheles; Anthropophilic; Hosts; Malaria; Opportunistic; Selection; Species; Zoophilic,cytochrome b; Anopheles; Anopheles bancroftii; Anopheles farauti; Anopheles hinesorum; Anopheles koliensis; Anopheles longirostris; Anopheles punctulatus; Article; controlled study; dog; female; foraging behavior; gene amplification; host availability; host parasite interaction; host selection; human; insecticide treated net; malaria; mitochondrial cytochrome b gene; mosquito; nonhuman; organismal interaction; Papua New Guinea; parasite transmission; pig; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; population size; species distribution; vector control; vertebrate; animal; Anopheles; blood; DNA fingerprinting; feeding behavior; mosquito vector; physiology; Animals; Anopheles; Blood; DNA Fingerprinting; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Mosquito Vectors; Papua New Guinea,English,,PacELF_3252 Keven-2017-Plasticity of host selection by mal.pdf
3253,JCU,870,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Predicting lymphatic filariasis transmission and elimination dynamics using a multi-model ensemble framework,"Mathematical models of parasite transmission provide powerful tools for assessing the impacts of interventions. Owing to complexity and uncertainty, no single model may capture all features of transmission and elimination dynamics. Multi-model ensemble modelling offers a framework to help overcome biases of single models. We report on the development of a first multi-model ensemble of three lymphatic filariasis (LF) models (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, and TRANSFIL), and evaluate its predictive performance in comparison with that of the constituents using calibration and validation data from three case study sites, one each from the three major LF endemic regions: Africa, Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). We assessed the performance of the respective models for predicting the outcomes of annual MDA strategies for various baseline scenarios thought to exemplify the current endemic conditions in the three regions. The results show that the constructed multi-model ensemble outperformed the single models when evaluated across all sites. Single models that best fitted calibration data tended to do less well in simulating the out-of-sample, or validation, intervention data. Scenario modelling results demonstrate that the multi-model ensemble is able to compensate for variance between single models in order to produce more plausible predictions of intervention impacts. Our results highlight the value of an ensemble approach to modelling parasite control dynamics. However, its optimal use will require further methodological improvements as well as consideration of the organizational mechanisms required to ensure that modelling results and data are shared effectively between all stakeholders. © 2017 The Authors",2017,"Smith M.E., Singh B.K., Irvine M.A., Stolk W.A., Subramanian S., Hollingsworth T.D., Michael E.",Epidemics,,18,16-28,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2017.02.006,Multicountry Global,3253,Open,Control dynamics; Lymphatic filariasis; Macroparasite dynamics; Model calibration and validation; Multi-model ensemble; Neglected tropical disease,"adolescent; adult; Africa; aged; Article; calibration; child; female; follow up; human; lymphatic filariasis; major clinical study; male; management; middle aged; multi model ensemble framework; nonhuman; Papua New Guinea; parasite control; parasite transmission; pathogen clearance; prevalence; priority journal; simulation; Southeast Asia; validation study; communicable disease control; endemic disease; lymphatic filariasis; theoretical model; transmission; Africa; Asia, Southeastern; Communicable Disease Control; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Endemic Diseases; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Papua New Guinea",English,,PacELF_3253 Smith et al 2017 EPIDEMICS Multi model LF transmission -s2.0-S1755436516300615.pdf
3254,JCU,871,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Surveillance efforts after mass drug administration to validate elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in Vanuatu,"Background: Vanuatu was formerly highly endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF), caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. After a baseline survey showing 4.8% antigen prevalence in 1998, the country conducted nationwide (in one implementation unit) annual mass drug administration (MDA) with albendazole and diethylcarbamazine citrate from 2000 to 2004 and achieved prevalence of 0.2% by 2006 in a representative nationwide cluster survey among all age groups. Methods: Post MDA surveillance was conducted from 2006 to 2012. After MDA, the country was divided for surveillance into three evaluation units (EUs) formed by grouping provinces according to baseline prevalence: EU1: Torba, Sanma and Malampa; EU2: Penama; EU3: Shefa and Tafea. The study compiled all past data and information on surveys in Vanuatu from the country programme. This paper reviews the surveillance activities done after stopping MDA to validate the interruption of transmission and elimination of LF as a public health problem. Results: Post-MDA surveillance consisting of at least three transmission assessment surveys (TAS) in each of the three EUs was conducted between 2006 and 2012. Sentinel and spot check surveys identified a few villages with persistent high prevalence; all antigen positive cases in these sites were treated and additional targeted MDA conducted for 3 years in 13 villages in one area of concern. All three EUs passed all TAS in 2007, 2010 and 2012 respectively, with no positives found except in EU2 (Penama province) in 2012 when 2 children tested positive for circulating filariasis antigen. Assessment of the burden of chronic filariasis morbidity found 95 cases in 2003 and 32 remaining cases in 2007, all aged over 60 years. Conclusions: Vanuatu has achieved validation of elimination of LF as a public health problem. Post-validation surveillance is still recommended especially in formerly highly endemic areas. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,"Taleo F., Taleo G., Graves P.M., Wood P., Kim S.H., Ozaki M., Joseph H., Chu B., Pavluck A., Yajima A., Melrose W., Ichimori K., Capuano C.",Tropical Medicine and Health,,45(1),18,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-017-0057-6,Vanuatu,3254,Open,,adult; Article; disease elimination; female; health care survey; human; hydrocele; lymphatic filariasis; major clinical study; male; morbidity; parasite transmission; practice guideline; public health problem; treatment planning; trend study; Vanuatu,English,,PacELF_3254 Taleo_et_al-2017-Tropical_Medicine_and_Health Surveillance efforts after MDA Vanuatu.pdf

3257,JCU,874,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,"Heterogeneous dynamics, robustness/fragility trade-offs, and the eradication of the macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis","Background: The current WHO-led initiative to eradicate the macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF), based on single-dose annual mass drug administration (MDA) represents one of the largest health programs devised to reduce the burden of tropical diseases. However, despite the advances made in instituting large-scale MDA programs in affected countries, a challenge to meeting the goal of global eradication is the heterogeneous transmission of LF across endemic regions, and the impact that such complexity may have on the effort required to interrupt transmission in all socioecological settings. Methods: Here, we apply a Bayesian computer simulation procedure to fit transmission models of LF to field data assembled from 18 sites across the major LF endemic regions of Africa, Asia and Papua New Guinea, reflecting different ecological and vector characteristics, to investigate the impacts and implications of transmission heterogeneity and complexity on filarial infection dynamics, system robustness and control. Results: We find firstly that LF elimination thresholds varied significantly between the 18 study communities owing to site variations in transmission and initial ecological parameters. We highlight how this variation in thresholds lead to the need for applying variable durations of interventions across endemic communities for achieving LF elimination; however, a major new result is the finding that filarial population responses to interventions ultimately reflect outcomes of interplays between dynamics and the biological architectures and processes that generate robustness/fragility trade-offs in parasite transmission. Intervention simulations carried out in this study further show how understanding these factors is also key to the design of options that would effectively eliminate LF from all settings. In this regard, we find how including vector control into MDA programs may not only offer a countermeasure that will reliably increase system fragility globally across all settings and hence provide a control option robust to differential locality-specific transmission dynamics, but by simultaneously reducing transmission regime variability also permit more reliable macroscopic predictions of intervention effects. Conclusions: Our results imply that a new approach, combining adaptive modelling of parasite transmission with the use of biological robustness as a design principle, is required if we are to both enhance understanding of complex parasitic infections and delineate options to facilitate their elimination effectively. © 2016 Michael and Singh.",2016,"Michael E., Singh B.K.",BMC Medicine,,14(1),14,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-016-0557-y,Multicountry Global,3257,Open,Adaptability and evolvability; Biological complexity and robustness; Lymphatic filariasis; Mass drug administration; Parameter sloppiness; Parasite elimination programs; Parasite transmission heterogeneity; Vector control; Vector-borne neglected tropical diseases,"albendazole; diethylcarbamazine; ivermectin; Africa; Article; Asia; Bayes theorem; community; computer simulation; disease eradication; ecology; endemic disease; human; lymphatic filariasis; mathematical model; Papua New Guinea; parasite clearance; parasite transmission; parasite vector; vector control; disease eradication; disease transmission; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Neglected Diseases; prevention and control; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Africa; Asia; Bayes Theorem; Computer Simulation; Disease Eradication; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Elephantiasis, Filarial; Humans; Models, Statistical; Neglected Diseases; Papua New Guinea",English,,PacELF_3257 Michael Singh 2016 BMC MED Heterogeneous dynamics modeling s12916-016-0557-y.pdf
3258,JCU,875,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Historic accounts of Mansonella parasitaemias in the South Pacific and their relevance to lymphatic filariasis elimination efforts today,"There are two species of filarial parasites with sheathless microfilariae known to commonly cause parasitaemias in humans: Mansonella perstans and Mansonella ozzardi. In most contemporary accounts of the distribution of these parasites, neither is usually considered to occur anywhere in the Eastern Hemisphere. However, Sir Patrick Manson, who first described both parasite species, recorded the existence of sheathless sharp-tailed Mansonella ozzardi-like parasites occurring in the blood of natives from New Guinea in each and every version of his manual for tropical disease that he wrote before his death in 1922. Manson's reports were based on his own identifications and were made from at least two independent blood sample collections that were taken from the island. Pacific region Mansonella perstans parasitaemias were also later (in 1923) reported to occur in New Guinea and once before this (in 1905) in Fiji. Although Mansonella-parasitaemias are generally regarded as benign, they are thought to be of public health importance because they can affect the epidemiological monitoring of other filarial diseases. In this article, we reviewed the historic literature concerning Pacific-origin Mansonella-parasitaemias in an attempt to explain how, despite repeated reports of Pacific-region Mansonella-parasitaemias, by as early as the 1970s, the WHO had arrived at the present-day view that Wuchereria bancrofti is the only cause of filarial parasitaemias in Papua New Guinea. We have also evaluated the evidence supporting the contemporary existence of Pacific-area parasitaemia-causing Mansonella parasites and assessed the relevance such parasites could have for present-day lymphatic filariasis elimination efforts in the region. © 2016 Hainan Medical College.",2016,"Crainey J.L., Ribeiro da Silva T.R., Luz S.L.B.",Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine,,9(3),205-210,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apjtm.2016.01.040,Multicountry Pacific,3258,Open,Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis; Lymphatic filariasis; Mansonella ozzardi; Mansonella perstans; Papua New Guinea; Wuchereria bancrofti,DNA; RNA; blood analysis; blood sampling; DNA sequence; human; lymphatic filariasis; Mansonella ozzardi; Mansonella perstans; Mansonella streptocerca; microbial diversity; microfilaria (nematode larva); nonhuman; Onchocerca volvulus; Papua New Guinea; parasite clearance; parasite transmission; priority journal; Review; RNA sequence; scientific literature; tropical disease; tropical medicine; world health organization; Wuchereria bancrofti,English,,PacELF_3258 Crainey et al 2016 ASIAN PACIFIC J TROP MED Mansonella in S Pacific 1-s2.0-S1995764516000419-main.pdf
3259,JCU,876,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination in American Samoa: Evaluation of Molecular Xenomonitoring as a Surveillance Tool in the Endgame,"The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis has made significant progress toward interrupting transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF) through mass drug administration (MDA). Operational challenges in defining endpoints of elimination programs include the need to determine appropriate post-MDA surveillance strategies. As humans are the only reservoirs of LF parasites, one such strategy is molecular xenomonitoring (MX), the detection of filarial DNA in mosquitoes using molecular methods (PCR), to provide an indirect indicator of infected persons nearby. MX could potentially be used to evaluate program success, provide support for decisions to stop MDA, and conduct post-MDA surveillance. American Samoa has successfully completed MDA and passed WHO recommended Transmission Assessment Surveys in 2011 and 2015, but recent studies using spatial analysis of antigen (Ag) and antibody (Ab) prevalence in adults (aged ≥18 years) and entomological surveys showed evidence of possible ongoing transmission. This study evaluated MX as a surveillance tool in American Samoa by linking village-level results of published human and mosquito studies. Of 32 villages, seropositive persons for Og4C3 Ag were identified in 11 (34.4%), for Wb123 Ab in 18 (56.3%) and for Bm14 Ab in 27 (84.4%) of villages. Village-level seroprevalence ranged from 0–33%, 0–67% and 0–100% for Og4C3 Ag, Wb123 Ab and Bm14 Ab respectively. PCR-positive Aedes polynesiensis mosquitoes were found in 15 (47%) villages, and their presence was significantly associated with seropositive persons for Og4C3 Ag (67% vs 6%, p<0.001) and Wb123 Ab (87% vs 29%, p = 0.001), but not Bm14 Ab. In villages with persons seropositive for Og4C3 Ag and Wb123 Ab, PCR-positive Ae. polynesiensis were found in 90.9% and 72.2% respectively. In villages without seropositive persons for Og4C3 Ag or Wb123 Ab, PCR-positive Ae. polynesiensis were also absent in 94.1% and 70.6% of villages respectively. Our study provides promising evidence to support the potential usefulness of MX in post-MDA surveillance in an Aedes transmission area in the Pacific Islands setting. © 2016 Public Library of Science.

3260,JCU,877,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,Population genomics of the filarial nematode parasite Wuchereria bancrofti from mosquitoes,"Wuchereria bancrofti is a parasitic nematode and the primary cause of lymphatic filariasis - a disease specific to humans. W. bancrofti currently infects over 90 million people throughout the tropics and has been acknowledged by the world health organization as a vulnerable parasite. Current research has focused primarily on the clinical manifestations of disease and little is known about the evolutionary history of W. bancrofti. To improve upon knowledge of the evolutionary history of W. bancrofti, we whole genome sequenced 13 W. bancrofti larvae. We circumvent many of the difficulties of multiple infections by sampling larvae directly from mosquitoes that were experimentally inoculated with infected blood. To begin, we used whole genome data to reconstruct the historical population size. Our results support a history of fluctuating population sizes that can be correlated with human migration and fluctuating mosquito abundances. Next, we reconstructed the putative pedigree of W. bancrofti worms within an infection using the kinship coefficient. We deduced that there are full-sib and half-sib relationships residing within the same larval cohort. Through combined analysis of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes we concluded that this is likely a results of polyandrous mating, the first time reported for W. bancrofti. Lastly, we scanned the genomes for signatures of natural selection. Annotation of putative selected regions identified proteins that may have aided in a parasitic life style or may have evolved to protect against current drug treatments. We discuss our results in the greater context of understanding the biology of an animal with a unique life history and ecology. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2016,"Small S.T., Reimer L.J., Tisch D.J., King C.L., Christensen B.M., Siba P.M., Kazura J.W., Serre D., Zimmerman P.A.",Molecular Ecology,,25(7),1465-1477,https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13574,Papua New Guinea,3260,Contact PacELF at JCU,effective population size; inbreeding; lymphatic filariasis; mass drug administration; population genomics; Wuchereria bancrofti,"animal; genetic selection; genetics; genome; larva; mitochondrial genome; mosquito; Papua New Guinea; parasitology; phylogeny; population genetics; Wuchereria bancrofti; Animals; Culicidae; Genetics, Population; Genome, Helminth; Genome, Mitochondrial; Larva; Papua New Guinea; Phylogeny; Selection, Genetic; Wuchereria bancrofti",English,,PacELF_3260 Molecular Ecology - 2016 - Small - Population genomics of the filarial nematode parasite Wuchereria bancrofti from.pdf

Aliquots of 173 faecal samples preserved in ethanol originating from all schools were examined by real-time PCR, and the prevalence of SS infection was 3.5%. Our study confirms the existence of SS infection on Fiji and showed that assessing SS prevalence alongside TAS/STH survey is a convenient access platform, allowing introduction of other surveillance techniques such as BC and real-time PCR. © 2016 The Authors",2016,"Kim S.H., Rinamalo M., Rainima-Qaniuci M., Talemaitoga N., Kama M., Rafai E., Choi M.-H., Hong S.T., Verweij J.J., Kelly-Hope L., Stothard J.R.",Parasite Epidemiology and Control,,1(3),263-267,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parepi.2016.08.005,Fiji,3261,Open,Neglected tropical diseases; Pacific; Real-time PCR; Surveillance,albendazole; diethylcarbamazine; Article; child; disease transmission; epidemiological data; feces analysis; Fiji; health survey; human; larval stage; lymphatic filariasis; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; pilot study; preschool child; prevalence; real time polymerase chain reaction; school child; Strongyloides stercoralis; strongyloidiasis; treatment duration,English,,PacELF_3261 Kim et al 2016 Strongyloides Fiji 1-s2.0-S2405673116300253-main (1).pdf
3262,JCU,879,,,Electronic,Scientific Papers,The impact of insecticide-treated cloth targets on the survival of Stegomyia polynesiensis (= Aedes polynesiensis) under laboratory and semi-field conditions in French Polynesia,"The impact of deltamethrin-impregnated cloth targets on Stegomyia polynesiensis (= Aedes polynesiensis) (Marks) (Diptera: Culicidae) was assessed under laboratory and semi-field settings in French Polynesia. Stegomyia polynesiensis females were released into small laboratory cages and large field cages containing either a deltamethrin-treated or an untreated navy blue cloth, and mosquito knock-down and mortality were assessed. The 24-h mortality rate in mosquitoes exposed to the insecticide-treated target in small cages was 98.0%. These mosquitoes also demonstrated significantly higher levels of knock-down than those exposed to the untreated target. Mortality in field cages was assessed at 24 and 48 h. The 24-h mortality rate in mosquitoes exposed to the control target was 31.2%, whereas that in those exposed to the deltamethrin-treated target was 54.3%. The 48-h mortality rate was also elevated in mosquitoes exposed to the deltamethrin-treated target, but this result did not differ significantly from that observed in mosquitoes exposed to the control target. The significant suppression of female S. polynesiensis by deltamethrin-treated resting targets in this study indicates that these targets could play a role in the control of an important disease vector in the South Pacific region. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society.",2016,"Chambers E.W., Bossin H.C., Ritchie S.A., Russell R.C., Dobson S.L.",Medical and veterinary entomology,,30(3),247-252,https://doi.org/10.1111/mve.12180,French Polynesia,3262,Contact PacELF at JCU,lymphatic filariasis; Stegomyia polynesiensis (= Aedes polynesiensis); vector control,deltamethrin; insecticide; nitrile; pyrethroid; deltamethrin; disease control; disease vector; female; field method; impregnated bednet; laboratory method; mortality; mosquito; survival; Aedes; animal; female; insect control; Polynesia; standards; survival analysis; Aedes; Animals; Female; Insect Control; Insecticides; Nitriles; Polynesia; Pyrethrins; Survival Analysis; French Polynesia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Aedes polynesiensis; Culicidae; Diptera; Stegomyia,English,,PacELF_3262 Chambers et al 2016 Medical Vet Entomology - 2016 - CHAMBERS - The impact of insecticide‐treated cloth targets on the survival of Stegomyia.pdf
